<h3 id="PartI_I">I. CONSTRUCTION OF MEMORIALS TO SAMUEL CHAMPLAIN</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The first Report of this Commission was presented to the
Honorable the Legislature of the State of New York, September
19, 1911. Subsequently thereto Commissioner and Senator James
A. Foley, while still an Assemblyman, introduced a bill in the Assembly
designed to empower the Commission to build two suitable permanent
memorials to Samuel Champlain in that valley, one at Crown Point
Forts and the other at Plattsburgh. Commissioner and Senator James J.
Frawley had charge of the bill in the Senate. It was also designed to
extend the term of the Commission into the year 1913, long enough to
complete such memorials and to dedicate them with appropriate ceremonies.
That bill passed the Legislature and upon its approval by
Governor Dix, it became chapter 273 of the Laws of 1912. By its
terms, it imposed on the Commission the duty of submitting to the
Legislature of 1913, a full and complete report of its proceedings and
transactions.</p>

<p>On March 27, 1912, the New York Lake Champlain Tercentenary
Commission submitted its Financial Report to the Legislature, showing
its receipts and disbursements down to March 26, 1912. These two
reports of the Commission, already submitted to the Legislature, comprise
all the proceedings and transactions of the Commission down to
their respective dates, so that all that is necessary to do in this Final
Report is to continue the record of its proceedings and transactions from
such dates. This will include an account of the visit to this country of
the distinguished French delegation, headed by His Excellency, Monsieur
Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux in April and May, 1912,—an
event exponential of the perfect amity existing between the two
Republics—and also an account of the dedicatory ceremonies of the
Memorial Lighthouse at Crown Point Forts, New York, on July 5,
1912, and of the Champlain memorial at Plattsburgh, New York, on
July 6, 1912.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>These did not admit of so extensive an historical treatment of the
important events occurring in the Champlain valley, nor of so wide a
range of literary productions, as did the Tercentenary exercises, a
record of which may be found in the First Report of this Commission.
Nevertheless, the interchange of felicitations between the representatives
of France and of this country, the cordial greetings everywhere extended
to the French visitors and the amicable relations existing between the
two peoples, prompting the warmest expressions of good will and generous
impulses in addresses of rare literary quality, together with the
dedicatory ceremonies themselves, are worthy a permanent record in
this Final Report, thereby enlarging it into a volume, and are a fitting
sequel to the historical Tercentenary Celebration.</p>

<p>The Commissioners fully realized the opportunity at Crown Point
Forts for the construction and embellishment of a great Memorial Lighthouse
to commemorate the advent of Samuel Champlain, the herald
of civilization, into that valley, and they spared no pains to accomplish
that result.</p>

<p>After examining some American memorials to Samuel Champlain and
looking over the photographs of others and especially in view of the
utilitarian character of the Crown Point memorial in the form of a
Lighthouse and of its adaptability to sculptural embellishment, the
Commissioners decided to undertake the production of such a Memorial
after a design submitted by the architects, Messrs. Dillon, McLellan
&amp; Beadel of New York City, including a bronze statue group, the work
of the sculptor, Carl Augustus Heber, of New York City. For three
years, Mr. Heber was in the studios of Augustus St. Gaudens and Paul
Bartlett in Paris and afterward worked on the embellishments of the
Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo under Karl Theodore Francis
Bitter.</p>

<p>Among Heber’s more important works are the equestrian statue of
General Sheridan at Somerset, Ohio; the statue of Franklin at Princeton
University; the Schiller at Rochester, N. Y., the heroic statue “Roman
Poet” in the Brooklyn Institute, and the bronze statue in St. Andrew’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Church at Stamford, Connecticut. He received a medal at the St. Louis
Exposition for his “Pastoral” which is now in the museum of the
Chicago Art Institute, and he won the Avery prize at the Architectural
League in 1910.</p>

<p>Contracts were let to Booth Brothers and Hurricane Isle Granite
Company for the construction of the Memorial Lighthouse on the
property of the United States at Crown Point Forts of Fox Island
granite according to the design found at pages 346-347 of the original
Report of the Commission and for the bronze statue group after the
Heber model, consisting of a bronze statue of Champlain with one of
his soldiers crouching at his feet at one side and an Indian at the other.
Just below the group is a conventionalized stone canoe prow laden with
the products of the country. The work progressed as rapidly as was
planned. The Fox Island granite came from the State of Maine and had
to be delivered at Crown Point Forts, several miles distant from a railroad
station. The memorial was practically completed on July 5, 1912,
although the foundry work on the bronze statue group was not finished,
but was in place before the close of navigation. The Commissioners
are gratified that the entire memorial, including granite and bronze
work, and architects’ fees, was completed within the contract price of
approximately $51,313.83, and has been generally approved by the
Governors of New York and Vermont and by all others who have
passed judgment upon it. In the production of such memorials, where
æsthetics must be combined with utilitarian purposes, not readily susceptible
of artistic treatment, it is not to be determined <i lang="la">a priori</i> from
plans, what the result may be and especially when so much depends
upon the location and landscape surroundings, as in the case of this
memorial.</p>

<p>The artistic features of this memorial with its group of bronze
statuary, with the Rodin allegorical bust “La France” set in its
granite base, with eight free standing Doric columns surrounding its
central shaft, supporting a visitors’ gallery, that gives a wide outlook
over the lake and above that, a lantern platform 50 feet from the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
all surmounted by a circular capital with the garlands of the frieze
binding the top together rising 73 feet above the circular terrace and 101
feet above the level of the lake and in the main after the style of the
architecture prevailing in France at the time of Champlain, are rather
accentuated by the grandeur of the natural scenery surrounding it, produced
by the rugged Adirondacks in the west, the long expanse of
undulating waters in the north, historic Chimney Point, the fertile fields,
green vales and receding mountains in the east and the majestic ivy-clad
ruins in the south, all under an azure vault of sky, “glorious as the gates
of Heaven.” This memorial of highly artistic design with surroundings
of such natural beauty and sublimity and nearly “throned among the
hills” cannot fail to make an impression on the imagination and to produce
a pleasing effect upon the mind, which is said by Sir Joshua
Reynolds to be “the end of art.”</p>

may be found elsewhere in this volume. It was erected under the supervision
of Commissioners Walter C. Witherbee, Howland Pell, James
Shea, Louis C. Lafontaine and the chairman, Hon. H. Wallace Knapp.
The Legislature authorized the construction of two permanent memorials
to Samuel Champlain in the Champlain valley by chapter 181 of the
Laws of 1911. The Commissioners appointed to supervise the construction
of the Champlain memorial at Plattsburgh, were Judge John
B. Riley, Judge John H. Booth, Senator James A. Foley and Hon.
William R. Weaver, together with the chairman, the Hon. H. Wallace
Knapp. They employed Messrs. Dillon, McLellan &amp; Beadel to design
the Plattsburgh memorial, the same architects who designed the Crown
Point Memorial. Carl Augustus Heber was employed as the sculptor
for the Plattsburgh Champlain Statue. The city of Plattsburgh purchased
a commanding site for the memorial on the north shore of the
harbor, below the outlet of the Saranac river overlooking Cumberland
Bay and Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>The Plattsburgh memorial has been described by the architects as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<p>The Plattsburgh memorial to Samuel Champlain consists of a statue
and pedestal standing on a terrace in a park overlooking Lake Champlain.
The Terrace is bordered by a granite coping, and a flight of
steps leads down to the lake.</p>

<p>The pedestal is square, slightly tapering toward the top. It is twenty-two
feet high, and built of Massachusetts pink granite. It stands on a
platform two steps above the terrace. Its base is surrounded by a
granite seat and ornamented in front by the figure of a crouching Indian
with bow and shield, carved in granite; at each side by a canoe prow
with trophies typical of America in Champlain’s time; and at the rear by
a bronze tablet bearing the names of the Commissioners.</p>

<p>The canoe prows were chosen because the birch bark canoe is one of
the highest achievements, both constructively and artistically, of any
primitive race, and is typical of Eastern North America. Strongly and
ingeniously made of materials found in the woods, seaworthy, capable
of carrying a heavy load, and so light that it could easily be carried from
one waterway to another, it provided the quickest and easiest means of
travel for the Indians and for the explorers of this part of the country.
Without its assistance, journeys such as Champlain’s would have been
vastly more difficult, if not impossible.</p>

<p>The type is fast disappearing with our forests, so it seems fitting to
perpetuate it in stone on the monument to Champlain, to whom it was of
such service.</p>

<p>The upper part of the pedestal is decorated with carved garlands of
Indian corn, and bears the following inscription on the front and back
respectively:</p>

<p class="p1">The statue of Champlain, which is nearly twelve feet high and of
bronze, represents him in his soldier costume holding in his hand the
arquebuse of which he speaks in his memoirs. This and his breastplate,
helmet or morion, cloak, doublet, boots, and sword follow carefully the
style of his period: the arquebuse, morion and sword being modelled
after the ancient pieces in the collection of Hon. Howland Pell.</p>

<p>The monument was designed by Dillon, McLellan &amp; Beadel, the
architects of the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse at Crown Point
Forts, and the sculpture was done by Carl A. Heber, who modelled the
Crown Point memorial figures.</p>

<p>Contracts were let to Booth Brothers and Hurricane Isle Granite
Company for the granite work of the Plattsburgh Memorial, which was
to be built of Massachusetts pink granite and also for the bronze tablet,
steps, coping, etc., and to Carl A. Heber, the sculptor for the bronze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
statue of Champlain and for the models of the Indian, canoe prow and
garlands. The approximate cost of the entire memorial, including
architects’ fees, was $20,263.51. This memorial was completed in
time for dedication on July 6, 1912. It is a stately and dignified
memorial after an original design, about 34 feet high and rising 61½
feet above the level of the lake, and so located as to be readily seen from
the decks of passenger steamers entering the port of Plattsburgh. As a
work of art, it will stand comparison with any of the memorials to
Samuel Champlain in this country.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">As the memorials neared completion, it was learned through His
Excellency, Jean Adrien Antoine Jules Jusserand, the French
Ambassador, that His Excellency, Clément Armand Fallières,
President of the Republic of France, and the French people were raising
funds to purchase and present to the Lake Champlain Tercentenary
Commissions, which was to become a part of the Champlain memorial
at Crown Point Forts, <ins class="corr" id="tn-13" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'an allegorial bust'">
an allegorical bust</ins> by one of their noted sculptors.
The cordial relations existing between the people of France and the
people of America, as a result of the Champlain Tercentenary Celebration,
awakened in the two peoples something of that friendship, which
naturally springs from the pursuit of common purposes, similar ideals and
like humanitarian impulses. The Tercentenary tributes to the God-fearing
Champlain, whose noble qualities of mind and heart and whose unrequited
services to mankind afford the occasion for the intermingling of
the two races and the interchange of expressions of good will and cordial
greetings, touched the hearts of the French people as nothing else had done,
since the time when the people of this country bestowed their tributes on
that other distinguished Frenchman and patriot, Marquis de Lafayette,
whose services to this nation have ever since provoked the praises of our
countrymen. This appears from what followed.</p>

<p>Through the columns of <cite>Le Figaro</cite> of December 22, 1911, His Excellency,
Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux, of the French Academy
and President of the Franco-American Committee, which assumed the
undertaking of procuring the Rodin allegorical bust, “La France,”
appealed to the people of France to support the Committee in its undertaking.
In the course of this appeal (rendered into English), he said:</p>

the greatest is that of Champlain. He was at once both founder and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
originator. Canada owes its existence to him. Quebec celebrated three years
ago the memory of the man who having full consciousness of what he did placed
the first stone of the French metropolis in America. He had also “great plans
and vast thoughts.” A man of action, he was a man of imagination. He dreamed
of the establishment for the benefit of France, of an immense dominion covering
the American continent from Canada to Louisiana and Florida, through the valley
of the Mississippi. This was neither more nor less than the idea of the future
Republic of the United States, but in Champlain’s thought it was a matter of a
French America. On the very first page of his book (now so rare and so much
sought for by book-lovers), a book which he dedicated to the Cardinal Richelieu,
the only one capable of comprehending him, Champlain explains his thought in
terms of thrilling clearness. “It is necessary,” he wrote in 1632, “that under
the reign of King Louis the Just, France beholds herself enriched with a country,
the extent of which exceeds sixteen hundred leagues in length and more than five
hundred in width, and that in a continent which leaves nothing to be desired in
the bounty of its lands and in the profit which can be drawn from them, both for
foreign commerce and for the delights of life therein. The communication of the
great rivers and lakes, which are like seas stretching across these countries, affords
so great facility for all discoverers in the remote regions that one can go to the
seas of the west, of the east, of the far north, or even to the south.” When I
cited this same page in 1898, I added: “Sixteen hundred leagues by five hundred!
These are proportions over which one can now labor only in Africa.”</p>

<p>No doubt the great cities which will one day grow up on the banks of the
Sangha, of the Oubanghi, and of the Congo, will celebrate Brazza, even as the
United States prepare to glorify Champlain.</p>

<p>Some months ago our Ambassador at Washington, M. J. J. Jusserand, called
the attention of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the frequency of French commemorations
in the United States. He mentioned especially the approaching
erection on the borders of Lake Champlain of a monument consecrated to the
memory of our compatriot and he asked the Government to act so that France
would not be “absent” from these exercises so honorable to her. The Minister
of Foreign Affairs laid the matter before the Franco-American Committee, who in
turn makes its appeal to the public.</p>

<p>It is not desirable, indeed it is not proper that France absolutely ignore what is
being done for her. Can she forget past services? Nations have the right to be
ungrateful, but they cannot neglect courtesies—that would be inexcusable. A
lack of good manners is worse than a fault. Since North America, or, to speak
more exactly, the states of New York and Vermont, wish to remember, would
we not be obstinate to forget?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The monument under construction is admirably adapted to the place and to the
claims of the man, which it is designed to celebrate. There is at the extremity
of the lake discovered by Champlain, and which bears his name, a lighthouse,
throwing its rays over the waters of which, he, first of Europeans, contemplated
the immense extent, empty and wild, and which are now traversed by the fleet of
great steamboats, the region peopled by a swarm of men. A solid mass of masonry,
a crown of columns bearing a terrace, and above all the lantern of the lighthouse,
these are from base to summit the members of this powerful architecture. From
the mass of masonry rises a rostrum, beneath which Champlain stands like a pilot.</p>

<p>What can France do? What should she do? What stone worthy of her can
she bring to the monument? There is but one solution. It is that this stone must
be precious.... We are at the house of Rodin. It is known how popular
his name is in America. The great sculptor whose renown extends over the
world has nowhere more ardent admirers. We hasten through the great rooms
of the Hotel Biron. These great bare halls, full of the genius from which administrative
barbarism is undertaking to shut out the glory, and among so many masterpieces
where admiration exhausts itself, we discover (that is the true word, for
the remarkable modesty of the master scarcely pointed it out to us) a bronze bust:
<em>France</em>. Imagine the emotion of this finding! We sought an image, a symbol,
I may say a signature of our country, to send out there and we find France herself,
a darling France, full of grace, of spirit and of courage; a young French
woman to the sensitive nostrils, to the full cheeks; to the chin, delicate and obstinate,
to the glance, loyal, headstrong and brave; a young woman in whom are summed
up our Clotilde, our Blanche, our Henriette and our Jeanne, crowned with her
tresses as with a helmet, armed with her attire as with a cuirass. We sought for
a French conception and we find the very image of France. It is this figure we
wish to send out there, that it may be placed near the monument of Champlain.
In front of the mass of masonry, a light construction, an “edicule,” which will be
like a stone shrine sheltering and isolating the bust. And thus French art will carry
its offering simply and beautifully, associating it with the powerful American
commemoration.</p>

<p>If the idea appears good and worthy, worthy of the Government and of the
Embassy, which has been confided to us, worthy of the man who was three centuries
ago the champion of our country, worthy of the sister republic, then it is
necessary that friends sign this visiting-card which will be sent out there in her name.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the monument will take place next July. A French delegation
will go to deliver Rodin’s bronze to the building committee. Time presses.
We must be ready by the day named. The bronze which requires some alterations
will be quickly completed. But it is further necessary that the architect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
place the edicule, that they cut the stone, that they engrave it in order that the
thought of the master make in the ensemble a delicate, proud work, a flower of
France, blossoming in good art at the foot of the colossal monument.</p>

<p>A little money is needed. But above all is needed a prompt expression to
prevent at once any fault of taste and lack of precision. The <cite>Figaro</cite> opens its
columns to us. The <cite>Times</cite>, the <cite>Matin</cite>, the Parisian press aid us. To-day appears
the first subscription list. We make appeal to the friends of America and to the
friends of France, that it may be rapidly closed up.</p>
</div>

<p>To this patriotic appeal generous response was made and the bust was
secured. On April 26, 1912, the French delegation on their superb
steamship <i>France</i> of La Compagnie Générale Transatlantique in
New York harbor was welcomed by members of the New York Lake
Champlain Tercentenary Commission, Viscount de Jean, Secretary of
the French Embassy at Washington, M. Étienne Marie Louis Lanel,
French Consul-General at New York, Paul Fuller, Jr., representing the
Franco-American Committee, Hon. McDougall Hawkes, representing
the Franco-American Institute in the United States, and Mr. Henry L.
Beadel, one of the architects of the Champlain Memorials. The interchange
of greetings between the members of the Tercentenary Commission
and the visitors prepared the way for the receptions that were to
follow at New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Montreal,
Quebec, and elsewhere. The delegation was accompanied by Hon.
Robert Bacon, former United States Ambassador to France, and was
one of the most representative that had ever come over from France. It
included in its membership:</p>

<p>His Excellency, Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux, of the French
Academy, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the delegation;
Hon. Louis Barthou, Member of the Chamber of Deputies, former
Minister of Justice; Baron D’Estournelles de Constant, Member of the
French Senate and of The Hague International Tribunal; M. René
Bazin of the French Academy; General Lebon, Grand Officer of the
Legion of Honor and Member of the Superior Council of War; M.
Étienne Lamy of the French Academy; M. Fernand Cormon, painter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
President of the Academy of Fine Arts; Count Charles de Chambrun,
Secretary of the French Embassy at Washington, representing President
Poincaré of the Council of Ministers; M. Paul Vidal de le Blache,
Member of the Institute, representing the University of Paris; Le Duc
Choiseul, descendant of an old distinguished French family; Count de
Rochambeau, descendant of Count de Rochambeau, in command of the
French forces in America during the Revolution; M. J. Dal Piaz,
Director-General of La Compagnie Générale Transatlantique; M. Louis
Blériot, Engineer and Aviator; M. Antoine Girard, Commercial
Explorer; M. Léon Barthou, delegate from the Aero Club of France;
M. Gabriel Louis Jaray, Member of the Council of State and Secretary
of the General Franco-American Committee; M. Gaston Deschamps,
representing “<cite>Le Temps</cite>;” M. Régis Gignoux, representing “<cite>Le
Figaro</cite>;” M. Roger Gouel, Secretary of the delegation; the Countess
de Rochambeau; Madame Blériot; Miss Valentine Girard and Miss
Madeline Cormon.</p>

<p>Baron D’Estournelles de Constant, so favorably known to Americans
on account of his advocacy of International Peace on a former visit to
this country, introduced the members of the delegation to members of the
New York Commission, which presented to each visitor one of the official
souvenir Champlain badges and later a copy of the first edition of the
Official Report of the Tercentenary Celebration. The mission of the
delegation was to bring and present to the New York and Vermont
Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions the allegorical bust “La
France,” by Auguste Rodin, bearing the following inscription:</p>

<p class="p1 center">
LE XX JUILLET MDCIX LE FRANÇAIS S. CHAMPLAIN<br>
A DÉCOUVERT LE LAC QUI PORTE SON NOM.<br>
LE III MAI MCMXII LES ÉTATS DE<br>
NEW-YORK ET DE VERMONT<br>
ÉLEVANT CE MONUMENT<br>
UNE DÉLÉGATION FRANÇAISE<br>
A SCELLE CETTE FIGURE DE<br>
“LA FRANCE.”<br>
</p>

<p class="fs80 pad2">A. Rodin</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p class="p1">The architects of the Crown Point memorial thus described the bust:</p>

<p>The plaque represents France with a head-dress that follows somewhat
the form of a liberty cap, and is half-indicated as the skin of a cock.
A claw and a comb seem almost discernible in the boldly modelled
planes and ridges. “La France” herself is a young woman with a
strong face. The nose is modelled in a few bold planes, and is large.
The eyes are staring and archaic. The mouth is firm, but is more kindly
modelled than the nose, and the chin and cheeks are rounded, and,
though firm, more feminine than the rest of the countenance. The pose
is alert, even aggressive. It is too masculine to be immediately attractive,
but familiarity with it seems to subdue its harshness and bring out its
charm, until it is seen to possess that indescribable quality of mystery
that belongs to a few famous portraits.</p>

<p>M. Hanotaux said that “it was fit to replace the Mona Lisa.” Perhaps
he is right. There is no doubt at least that it is the work of a
master. It has been placed on the front of the pedestal that carries the
statue of Champlain.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Allegorical Interpretation.</h4>

<p class="center">[Suggested by Henry W. Hill, Secretary of the Commission.]</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing technical description, this <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i> may
also have another interpretation, for it was designed to symbolize France,
through the transformation of ten centuries of turbulence, revolution and
evolution, the center of the Republican movement in Europe and finally
emerging triumphantly reconstructed and self-reliant, the exponent
among Continental nations of the liberty, equality and fraternity of
mankind. In her new Renaissance of constitutional government, the
spirit of intense patriotism has taken possession of her people and France
is another illustration of the solidarity of those communities and stability
of those nations, which are actuated by and founded upon popular
liberties.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/fp18.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Front View of Rodin Bust “La France”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In contemplating this work, we are made to realize that the French
as well as the Italians have an intuitive appreciation of the ideals in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
æsthetics and they are setting the standards of their ideals in art so high,
that France as well as Italy is leading most other nations in artistic achievement
as may be seen in the marvelous productions of her modern sculptors,
whose works are not only found in the Louvre, the Musée du Luxembourg
and in other collections, but also adorn the palaces, boulevards and
public grounds of Paris and other municipalities of France.</p>

<p>The moderate encouragement given there to art by the state and the
people of the country has undoubtedly stimulated original and creative
production in sculpture as well as in painting, notwithstanding the apathy
once described by Théodore Duret, who declared that “there is nothing
sadder to recount in the whole history of art than the persecution inflicted
upon truly original and creative artists of the country.” In this
martyrdom of those devoted to æsthetic achievements the world over
inheres the truth of the Roman adage, <i lang="la">patitur qui vincit</i>. Auguste
Rodin, who was born in Paris in 1840 and elected President of the International
Society of Sculptors, Painters and Engravers in 1904, has conquered
and lives to see his works admired in both hemispheres, notwithstanding
his disregard of the canons and conventionalities of the French
Institute, which were repulsive to him. He has devoted himself to a
mastery of nature, as zealously as did Michael Angelo to the study of
anatomy. He is original and creative and his works are now appreciated
by members of the Institute as well as by the savants in art the world
over. His success in his field of sculptural achievement is largely due
to his intense application to nature, as interpreted through the perspective
of a vivid imagination, a poetic temperament and a keen appreciation of
the beautiful and the sublime. These have impelled him to reject the
conventional details, due to uniform rules applying to all alike, regardless
of the individual characteristics, apparent in the works of many sculptors
and to devote himself to productions, which are the embodiment of individual
realism. In “La France,” one appreciates that he has produced
a work with an exuberance of detail as stately as the Greek conception
of the ideal head, shown in the marble copy of the Athene
Parthenos of Phidias. It is a production of marked originality and has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the character and the strength of the works of Donatello and of Michael
Angelo, which contain “infinitely subtle shades of form in each sinuosity
of contour” and are suggestive of living personalities. Whether or not
we accept the intuitional theory of æsthetics, propounded by Benedetto
Croce and others, that beauty is spiritual activity or expression and
nothing more and is not predicable of nature apart from expression, we
cannot fail to appreciate that the works of Rodin,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which are true to
nature or an improvement upon it, are illustrations of perfect æsthetic
expression and therefore fall within Signore Croce’s category of æsthetic
productions.</p>

<p>The allegorical bust, “La France,” a work of poetic symbolism, reveals
something of the culture and the contemplative character and native
resolution of that nation, which struggles and conquers and whose intellectual
development—through the various stages of a complex and
progressive civilization, broadened by the discovery of her navigators and
the assumption of the responsibility of colonial government of her own
and alien races, ameliorated by the responsiveness of her statesmen to
popular ideas, thus solving the perplexing problems of organization and
administration, enlightened by the brilliant achievements of her scientists
and of her littérateurs, ennobled by the ethical teachings of her philosophers
and uplifted by the inspiration of her poets and by the marvelous
creations of her sculptors, her painters and her architects—is the fruition
of that universal genius, which is regenerating and immortal. This has
enabled France to maintain a leading position in the onward march of
civilization and to mold her institutions in conformity to the world’s
approved ethical and political standards.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enumerate her contributions to art, to literature or
to science further than to call attention to the fact that her celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Pierre Simonde de Laplace was the first to unfold the Nebular Hypothesis
in his “Exposition du Système du Monde” to account for the
formation of the solar system, and that her Charles Messier was the first
to catalogue stationary objects so faint as to be hardly observable through
his small telescope and by him first named “nebulae.” The diaphanous,
spiral convolutions in such of these, as the great green nebula in Orion,
the brilliant white nebula in Andromeda and the whirlpool nebula in
Canes Venatici, by the aid of powerful telescopes, may now be photographed
and by the revelations of the spectroscope, their dimensions,
character and composition may be determined.</p>

<p>If these nebulae, first discovered by Messier, be distant universes, not
unlike the Milky Way, as suggested by Dr. Edward Arthur Fath, who
estimates the diameter of the nebula in Andromeda at thirty-five trillions
of miles, we at most have but little conception of their magnitude and the
wonders of the realms of infinite space about us. The contributions of
Laplace and Messier as well as of Lalande, Leverrier and others to
astronomy indicate to some extent the leading position France has always
taken in the domain of science and original research. All nations
recognize that <i lang="fr">La France est la patrie des sciences et des arts</i>.</p>

<p>Her contributions to civilization and to the world’s diplomacy entitle
her to the gratitude of other civilized nations.</p>

<p>The people of this nation are especially grateful to France for her
services in opening up the heart of this continent to its early settlers,
for her assistance to our people in their struggle for independence and
for other acts of friendship, gratefully acknowledged elsewhere in this
Report, the last of which is beautifully expressed in the gift of the
Rodin bust, “La France.”</p>

<h3 id="PartI_III">III. SOCIAL FUNCTIONS AND HOSPITALITIES EXTENDED
TO THE FRENCH VISITORS IN NEW
YORK, WASHINGTON, PHILADELPHIA, BOSTON
AND ELSEWHERE</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">Upon their disembarkation, the visitors took rooms in the Hotel
Vanderbilt. In the evening, they witnessed “Les Fourberies de
Scapin” of Molière, played by the students of French in the
College of the City of New York at the Carnegie Lyceum, and also the
French version of an English play. On April 27, 1912, Mayor Gaynor
received the delegation in the City Hall of New York and expressed his
pleasure at their safe arrival in the city. M. Hanotaux replied that it
was an honor to present their respects to the first citizen of the great city
of New York. On the same day, members of the French delegation and
members of the Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions were
tendered a luncheon at the Metropolitan Club in New York by Hon.
McDougall Hawkes, chairman of the American Board of the French
Institute in the United States. Mr. Hawkes in a graceful address welcomed
the guests and extended an invitation to the First Loan Exhibit of
the Institute that afternoon. In the course of his address he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your visit, Mons. Hanotaux, with other distinguished delegates from France,
who have come on so flattering and pleasing a mission, will constitute a strong
landmark in what has been so interestingly termed by the distinguished librarian
of the city of Paris, Marcel Poëte, the intellectual expansion of France in the
United States. This so-called expansion, based on intellectual relations between
the two countries, is in fact a natural corollary to other relations, which for more
than three centuries and a half, have inclined each towards the other in common
sympathies. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>He was followed by Ambassador Jusserand, Mayor Gaynor, Baron
D’Estournelles de Constant, M. Louis Barthou, Mr. Paul Fuller, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
spoke in French, and others. At the Loan Exposition that followed in
the East Gallery of the building of the American Arts Society, John W.
Alexander, President of the National Academy of Design and a Trustee
of the French Institute in the United States, in a brief address spoke of
the cordial reception given in France to students of art from this country
and welcomed the delegation in a most cordial manner to the Institute.
M. Fernand Cormon, President of the Fine Arts Academy of France,
expressed his thanks for the cordial welcome they had received and
declared that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="fs80 just">such occasions as the opening of the Museum of French Art in this country would
do much to bring artists of the two countries into closer communication and would
multiply the means and the occasions, through which Americans and the French
could better know and appreciate one another. For this good work, which has
been so auspiciously begun to-day, you will have our active co-operation and I
extend to you our sincere thanks. (Applause.)</div>
</div>

<p>On the following morning the members of the French delegation and
the members of the Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions were
received by former Senator William A. Clark at his Fifth Avenue home
and shown through his unique and valuable art collections, in which the
visitors expressed deep interest. They were surprised to find so extensive
and rare a collection in private hands, and congratulated Senator Clark
upon his acquisition and possession of it.</p>

<p>Members of the delegation took the afternoon train for Washington,
where they were met by Mr. Chandler Hale, Third Assistant Secretary
of State, an aide-de-camp of the President, and Count de Peretti de
la Rocca, Counsellor to the French Ambassador. On April 29th they
were accompanied by Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, Major-General
Leonard Wood, General Oliver and others on the <i>Dolphin</i>
to Mount Vernon, where M. Hanotaux on behalf of his compatriots
placed a wreath of flowers on the tomb of President Washington.</p>

<p>On their return to Washington, Ambassador and Mme. Jusserand
tendered them a reception at the French Embassy, which was attended
by the diplomatic corps and others, and later the National Press Club<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
also gave them a reception. In the evening Ambassador and Mrs.
Jusserand gave them a dinner at the French Embassy, which was followed
by a ball given by Mr. John Barrett at the Pan-American
Building.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, April 30th, they visited the Congressional
Library, the Supreme Court, the Senate and the House of Representatives
and were then entertained at luncheon at the White House by
President and Mrs. Taft, where informal expressions of good will concluded
the Washington visit.</p>

<p>They returned to New York in the afternoon and were given a reception
and dinner by La Compagnie Générale Transatlantique on board
the new steamship <i>France</i>, said to be one of the most artistically
decorated vessels that ever entered the harbor of New York and flying
the largest American flag ever unfurled from the masthead of any vessel,
the gift of Ambassador Robert Bacon to this ship on her maiden voyage.
Members of the Champlain Tercentenary Commissions were also guests
at the dinner, at which M. Paul Faguet, general agent of the company,
presided. Among the speakers were M. J. Dal Piaz, director-general of
the company, Ambassador Jusserand, M. Gabriel Hanotaux and others.
Later in the evening, the Society of the Cincinnati held a reception at the
beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Alexander at No. 4 West
58th Street, at which the members of the French delegation and the
members of the Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions were guests.
On the following day, some members of the French delegation accompanied
by Ambassador Robert Bacon went to Boston and were met by
Prof. W. H. Schofield of Harvard and William Rotch, president of the
Alliance Française at the south station. They were entertained at breakfast
by Prof. Schofield and at luncheon by President Lowell of Harvard,
where they addressed the students in French. Later in the afternoon
they visited the State House and were presented to Governor Foss.
Other members of the delegation went to Philadelphia, visited the University
of Pennsylvania and Independence Hall, where they saw many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
portraits of notable persons, including those of Marquis de Lafayette,
Count de Rochambeau, Count Matthieu Dumas, the general’s aide, and
others, in which they were deeply interested. They were then entertained
at luncheon by the Hon. Charlemagne Tower, former Ambassador
to Germany, and Mrs. Tower, at which luncheon were Dr. and Mrs.
S. Weir Mitchell, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Rosengarten and others.</p>

<h3 id="PartI_IV">IV. BANQUET AT THE WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL,
NEW YORK CITY, MAY 1, 1912, AND PRESENTATION
OF RODIN BUST “LA FRANCE”</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">All the members of the delegation returned to New York in the
afternoon to attend the principal State banquet tendered to them
under the auspices of the Lake Champlain Association and the
Tercentenary Commissions of New York and Vermont at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in the evening of May 1, 1912. The Astor gallery of
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel where the dinner was served, was beautifully
decorated with flowers and the flags of the two nations, intertwined,
emblematic of the intimate friendship existing between France and the
United States. Elaborate and beautifully designed menu cards with
photographs of the Champlain memorials and with the names of the
French delegation were provided and all other ante-prandial arrangements
had been carefully looked after by the Hon. Frank S. Witherbee
and Percival Wilds, the president and secretary of the Lake Champlain
Association, and by Hon. Howland Pell of the New York Tercentenary
Commission, to all of whom much credit is due for the success of the
banquet.</p>

<p class="noindent fs80 pad6">
*    *    *    *    *    Just in time to banquet<br>
The illustrious company assembled here.  *  *  *<br>
</p>

<p class="p1">On the dais were seated thirty-one of the distinguished guests, including
President John H. Finley of the College of the City of New York, the
Toastmaster, Ambassador Jusserand, Attorney-General George W.
Wickersham, representing the President of the United States, General
Horace Porter, former Ambassador to France, Hon. Robert Bacon,
former Ambassador to France, Lieutenant-Governor Thomas F. Conway,
Mayor William J. Gaynor, Hon. A. Barton Hepburn, members of
the French delegation, some members of the Lake Champlain Tercentenary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Commissions and others. The other members of the Tercentenary
Commissions and the other guests were grouped around thirty-two separate
tables, and among them were General Stewart L. Woodford,
former Ambassador to Spain, Governor John A. Mead of Vermont,
Hon. Francis Lynde Stetson, General Charles Davis, Adjutant-General
William Verbeck, Hon. J. G. McCullough, Hon. Frank S. Witherbee,
Hon. Henry W. Taft, Hon. Charles B. Alexander, Hon. McDougall

Viscount de Jean, Count Jacques de Portales, Count Henri de Saint
Seine, Count de La Fayette, M. Étienne Marie Louis Lanel, Hon. Edward
H. Butler, William P. Northrup and others.</p>

<p>The three hundred guests represented many of the historic families of
France and America, which had played an important part in the history
of the two countries. It was a notable assemblage and thoroughly representative
of the official life, culture and best citizenship of the two
nations.</p>

<p>After toasts to the President of the United States and to the President
of France, the band played The Star Spangled Banner and La Marseillaise.
Other national airs of France and the United States interspersed
the speeches and were productive of convivial feeling.</p>

<p>President Finley had before him on the table the keystone taken from
over the door of the birthplace of Samuel Champlain in Brouage. It
was encircled by the French flags on the table. His illuminating and
charming articles on “The French in the Heart of America,” commencing
in <cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite> for September, 1912, and continuing in
succeeding numbers of that periodical, show the wide extent of the French
settlements in America and something of America’s indebtedness to
France.</p>

<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of President John H. Finley</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My selection (by those representing the two Champlain Tercentenary Commissions
and by the Champlain Association, to whose officers the success of this great
occasion is to be credited)—my selection for this office to-night is due to no fitness
except the degree of my devotion to Champlain and the degree of my personal
debt to France. So far as I know, I am the only man in New York, if not in
the United States, who has ever made a pilgrimage to Champlain’s birthplace.
And no man in America is more grateful to France for his own birthplace. It is
not permitted me to speak my devotion to Champlain and my gratitude to France.
I will let this silent stone speak for me—this fragment of rock from the coast of
France, which was once a keystone in the arch over the doorway of the home in
Brouage in which, by tradition, Champlain was born. I have brought it across
the sea, in a French vessel, to rebuild it in some monument here or in Canada, or
between the two countries. To-night it is garlanded by flowers grown in America—in
tribute to that Brouage boy who has made American wildernesses blossom
as the rose. And I pour upon its face a libation in the wine of the land for whose
glory he dared, as a man, all perils of sea and land and died an exile beneath the
gray rock of Quebec, Champlain!</p>

<p>This stone will speak more effectively than my strange vocabulary, the welcome
I would give this most distinguished company from France to-day. Here is a
bit of France, still unnaturalized, that will vibrate in all its particles with joy when
it hears the voices that speak the most beautiful language on earth. (I have
only a fear that it will disintegrate in its happiness.)</p>

<p>What I would have this stone say will have eloquent supplement in what will
be said by those who represent the Nation, the States of New York and Vermont
and the city of New York. These, gentlemen of France, it is my honor to
present to you.</p>

<p>Those explorers, priests and coureurs des bois whom Champlain started out into
the West gave to the world for all time (and to a new nation for some time at
least) that most wonderful of all the valleys in the world, the Mississippi Valley.
And it is a noteworthy fact that the three heads of the co-ordinate branches of
our government come from that valley and from the banks of the rivers discovered
by the French. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court comes from the River,
which Sieur de La Salle with Tonty traced to the Gulf of Mexico. The Speaker
of the House of Representatives comes from the banks of that tumultuous and
shifting flood known as the Missouri, which Joliet and Marquette saw hurling great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
trees into the Mississippi. And the President of the United States comes from the
banks of a river of that same valley, also discovered, in all probability, by the
French,—the river along which they planted their plates of discovery, the river
which they called La Belle Rivière. I propose the health of the geographical son
of France, the President of the United States, who is represented here to-night by a
member of his Cabinet, Attorney-General Wickersham. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>As Dr. Finley poured a few drops of champagne over the stone the
banqueters went to their feet and cheered enthusiastically. President
Finley then presented Attorney-General Wickersham, delegated to
represent the President, who spoke as follows:</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Attorney-General George W. Wickersham</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Mr. Toastmaster, Mr. Ambassador, Members of the French Delegation, Ladies
and Gentlemen.</em>—In July, 1909, representatives of France, Canada and the
United States, and of the several states bordering on Lake Champlain, united in
celebrating the three hundredth anniversary of the discovery of that lake by the
great pioneer, whose name it bears. That discovery itself was but the occasion for
a savage combat between the Indians, whom Champlain accompanied and the
ferocious Iroquois whom they encountered. Only one ray of light struggles through
the miserable tale of barbaric celebration of the victory which the French firearms
enabled the Hurons to win over their enemies. That ray was the half successful
effort made by Champlain to check the infliction by his Indian companions of the
usual fiendish tortures upon their prisoners.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquotxx" lang="fr">

<p>Je leur remonstrois que nous n’usions point de ces cruautez, wrote Champlain
in the account of his Journeys (Voyages), et que nous les faisions
mourir tout d’un coup, et que s’ils vouloyent que je luy donnasse un coup
d’arquebuse, j’en serois content. Ils dirent que non, et qu’il ne sentiroit
point de mal. Je m’en allay d’avec eux comme fasché de voir tant de cruautez
qu’ils exercoient sur ce corps. Comme ils virent que je n’en estois contant,
ils m’appelerent et me dirent que je luy donnasse un coup d’arquebuse: ce que
je fis, sans qu’il en vist rien; et luy fis passer tous les tourmens qu’il devoit
souffrir, d’un coup, plustost que de la voir tyranniser. (Voyages, Oeuvres
de Champlain, III, pp. 197-8. Quebec, 1870.)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(I objected that we did not practice these cruelties, and that we killed our
enemies with one blow; that I would be content if they would let me shoot him
with my arquebuse. They said no; that he felt no pain. I turned away from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
them as though angered at such cruelty as they were inflicting upon the wretch.
Seeing that I was vexed, they called me back and said I could shoot him with my
arquebuse, which I did, without his knowing anything, thus ending the agony
which he was suffering at one shot, rather than to see him further tormented.)</p>

<p>In all the history of this man we find him the same—brave, simple, humane,
unselfish; the embodiment of patriotism and piety—an example of the finest
manly qualities.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, fitting that in perpetual memory of Samuel Champlain
there should be erected at the scene of the combat that signalized the discovery
of this lake—that same Crown Point that a century and a quarter later was
one of the first places to fall before the arms of American colonials in the War
of Independence—a lighthouse, whose beams shining through the darkness of
the night, even as the compassion of the good Champlain lightened the path of
Stygian horrors to the poor suffering savage whose miseries he ended, may warn
and guide the mariners on those dangerous waters, through dark and stormy nights,
to the safe haven where they would be.</p>

<p>And it is, therefore, a worthy object that brings this Embassy of the French
Nation from over seas to install at that lighthouse a bronze bas-relief of France,
wrought by the hands of one of the greatest of living sculptors—that Rodin,
whose name is as well known in America as in his native country; a token which
will remain there as an abiding symbol of the intimate part and mighty influence
which the French people have had in the history and development of America.</p>

<p>How many illustrious French names are written in the history of this continent,
from the earliest days of struggle with the miseries of rigorous climate and savage
aborigines, down to the cession by Napoleon of the vast territory of Louisiana!
What a roll of noble names of men who sacrificed all that makes life pleasant,
in the pursuit of ideals in which no thought of self entered, save the hope and
vision of that day when they should be greeted with the words:</p>

<p class="pad3">Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>The names of Cartier, Le Jeune, Brébeuf, Lalemant, La Salle, Joliet, Frontenac,
Hennepin, Marquette, Champlain, and many others rise before us. But among
them all, none is more worthy to be remembered than that of Samuel de Champlain.
When, in 1640, Père Le Jeune visited a place in the country of the
Hurons where Champlain had stopped longest in a journey he had made there
twenty-two years before, he recorded that,</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquotxx" lang="fr">

<p>sa reputation vit encore dans l’esprit de ces peuples barbares, qui honorent
mesme après tant d’années plusieurs belles vertus qu’ils admiroient en luy, et
particulierement sa chasteté et continence envers les femmes.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(his reputation still lives in the minds of these barbarous peoples, who honor, even
after so many years, many excellent virtues which they admired in him, and in particular
his chastity and continence with respect to the women).</p>

<p>And the good Le Jeune exclaims:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquotxx">

<p>Pleust à Dieu que tous les François qui les premiers sont venus en ces
contrées lui eussent esté semblables. (Jesuit Relations, Vol. XX, p. 18.)</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(Would to God that all the French who came first to this country had been
like unto him.)</p>

<p>In 1599, several years before coming to Canada, Champlain visited the Isthmus
of Panama, and noted that if a canal were cut across it one could pass from one
ocean to the other, thus shortening the distance from Spain to Peru by more than
fifteen hundred leagues. And as this Frenchman was the first<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to lay that project
of the Panama Canal before the world, so another great Frenchman, de Lesseps,
was the first to put the idea into practical application; and after proving that its
accomplishment was only possible if undertaken by a Government, to hand it over
to the traditional friend of France,—its successor in the ownership of the great
territory of Louisiana—to complete the divorcement of the continent, which, as
Champlain wrote, would divide America into two islands: one from Panama to
the Straits of Magellan, and the other from Panama to the new lands (Terres
Noeufves).</p>

<p>In 1878 we celebrated the centennial anniversary of the Treaty of Alliance,
and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, with France.</p>

<p>In 1903 we celebrated the centennial anniversary of the Treaty of Cession of
Louisiana.</p>

<p>In 1904 we concluded the purchase from the French Panama Canal Company
of its interests in the Isthmian Canal.</p>

<p>In 1909 we celebrated the three hundredth anniversary of the discovery by
Champlain of the great lake with which his name is forever linked.</p>

<p>To-night, in the name and on behalf of the President of the United States, I
welcome the Embassy from the French people that brings to the American people
a token of the perpetual friendship which an indissoluble union in the past makes
sure of continuance in the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>No more distinguished or representative Embassy has ever come bearing the
greetings of one people to another. Glancing over the names of those that comprise
it, one sees those of the most distinguished exponents of all that is best in
French national life. History, Literature, Art, Journalism; the cause of International
Peace, and Arms, which ensure its continuance; Industry, Commerce
and Sport—all these are represented. To one and all of you, America extends
a welcome. And in the name, and on behalf, of the President of the United
States I accept this bronze relief of France, which will be erected on the lighthouse
at Crown Point, as a perpetual reminder of the good will of that people
who are united with us by the memory of many evidences of disinterested friendship
in the past and of a common devotion to Republican principles in the present.
(Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President Finley then introduced Ambassador Jusserand as follows:</p>

<p>We welcome the special embassies that come from time to time, but
that is partly because of our affection and admiration for the permanent
Ambassador from the Republic of France. It was rumored a few days
ago that he was to be promoted to another court. Of course, in our
opinion transfer to another court is not a promotion. But in any event,
we are sure of this: that court is the most fortunate to whose sovereign
he is accredited. I propose the health of the sovereign who has accredited
him to us, the President of the French Republic.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Ambassador Jusserand</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been accredited to the United States almost ten years, and although this
beats the record of any of my predecessors, from the founding of this Republic,
this space of time, spent in such a friendly country, among a people that has never
allowed me to feel that I was not in my own land, has passed for me like a day.
What has just been said by our Chairman, an historian, a thinker, a man of action,
a scientist who has delighted the French of to-day by his studies of the French of
the past, showing to both a similar broad sympathy, touches me deeply. I cannot
imagine with the sound of his words in my ears, what amount of time would ever
seem long to me, in a post where the President of the French Republic and his
representative are spoken of in such a fashion by such a friend.</p>

<p>It was my privilege, three years ago, to attend, in the society of the President
of the United States, memorable ceremonies, lasting several days, held by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Sons of America in honor of a son of France, Samuel Champlain. The year
was a busy one for President Taft, since it was a tariff year, yet he did not hesitate
to lend his presence to festivities for which, in every bay, on every promontory, in
every city, his eloquence, good humor and good grace were in ceaseless request.
He had been advised that one speech would be expected of him, and I had received
the same notification; so we had each prepared one, but he had to deliver six and
I five; Ambassador Bryce had a similar fate, such being the way of the world,
and especially of the New World.</p>

<p>Many of you, I am sure, remember the grandeur of the ceremonies to which a
peerless landscape lent its lovely background, and the summer sun its splendor,
and the Champlain Commission the charms of a most gracious hospitality; the
visits to Ticonderoga just rising from its ruins, to Bluff Point, Plattsburgh, Burlington;
the excellent addresses of President Taft, of Ambassador Bryce, Senator
Root, Mr. Lemieux of Canada and so many others, and you remember too with
what alacrity New York and Vermont vied with each other, Governor Hughes
and Governor Prouty making everybody welcome and delighting innumerable
hearers with the wit and wisdom of their speeches.</p>

<p>But this was not enough, and with that warmth of heart so characteristic of
this nation, you have desired that permanent memorials should, to the end of time,
bear testimony to the gratitude due to Champlain, not only for the discoveries
he made, but also for the examples he left us. When this intention became known
to my compatriots, it profoundly touched them, and they begged permission to
take part in these homages, thus evidencing once more, the unity of feeling between
the two Republics east and west of the great Ocean. Hence the coming to these
shores of the Delegation headed by Mr. Hanotaux which you are welcoming
to-night, a representative one, where the French Academy, the French Parliament,
the French Army, French art, science, industry, commerce, press and, let us not
forget that Franco-American art, aviation, have their spokesmen.</p>

<p>The news of your intentions moved the more deeply the hearts of my compatriots
that, after a long interruption, the task of Champlain, that task so well
described by our Chairman of to-night, President Finley, in his Sorbonne lectures,
has been resumed in the same spirit by our Republic of to-day.</p>

<p>“The French,” wrote in the sixteenth century the great Italian poet Tasso, “are
by nature unable to stand still and do nothing. When they cease to be in action,
they wither like the mechanism of a clock that gets rusty if not in use.” We have
been in no danger in these latter years, of rusting. If, on several continents, success
has attended our efforts, it is because we took our inspiration from the precepts
and examples left by the far-off ancestors, Champlain and his peers. Justice,
friendliness, a desire to help and improve, must ever be among the chief articles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of the colonist’s creed. The one sense to which throughout the world, even the
lowest type of humanity responds, is the sense of Justice.</p>

<p>Such was the opinion of your leaders too, of Washington above all others, who
wrote to Lafayette: “The basis of our proceedings with the Indian nations has
been and shall be Justice.” And, at this day, in the distant Philippine Islands,
where schools have so much multiplied and President Taft has left, as a Governor,
such noteworthy examples, this rule is known to be your rule.</p>

<p>As for our own men they felt in the same way, that the contact with the white
man ought to be a blessing, not a bane, to the less advanced races. Champlain,
Joliet, La Salle were of one mind and opposed to the best of their ability the
sale of “fire-water” to the natives; and a similar principle continues in force to-day
in your Indian reservations. As to the development of the country by slave labor
or by that of hired servants, Charlevoix wrote those memorable words: “I should
prefer the last. When the time of their service is expired, they become inhabitants
and increase the number of the King’s natural subjects, whereas the first are always
strangers: and who can be assured that, by continually increasing in our colonies,
they will not one day become formidable enemies? Can we depend upon slaves
who are only attached to us by fear and for whom the very land where they are
born has not the dear name of Mother-country?”</p>

<p>In this, as is so often the case, interest and virtue combine: both give the colonist
the same advice; which, as mankind progresses, it will be more and more dangerous
to discard. The measure of success we have reached is, I hope, founded
on no less stable a basis. What this success has been and whether we are or not
worthy compatriots of Champlain, let those determine who have recently visited
our colonial empire; and I for one would gladly abide by the judgment of such
American travelers as Edgar Allen Forbes, in his <cite>Land of the White Helmet</cite>.</p>

<p>By this delegation an image is brought to you, the image of France. More
than once before, under one form or another, when the struggle was for independence
or for greatness, it appeared on these shores, and was a good omen.
The exchange of tokens of friendship between two nations with so much in common
in the past, so much in the future, with their similar aims, has been ceaseless. Be
assured that our hearts beat in unison with yours, and will ever remember with
gratitude what is now being done to honor a son of France by the states of New
York and Vermont, and by that generous, hospitable, tireless committee, the
Champlain Committee.</p>

<p>The ancients used to place amulets as harbingers of good luck in the foundations
of their great buildings. The figure of France to be placed on the base of
the Champlain monument is being offered to you, not merely as a thing of beauty,
but also as an amulet to bring luck to a nation whom we have never ceased to love.
(Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>In presenting the next speaker, President Finley said:</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was in great peril of losing my life by falling off
the western boundary of the State of New York into the Niagara river.
I was trying to follow the path of the Frenchmen who carried from Lake
Ontario to a point several miles above the Falls, the equipment for the
first sailing vessel to navigate the waters of the Upper Lakes. While I
was climbing to a narrow ledge of rock covered with ice, a hundred feet
above the river, I appreciated as never before the hardihood of the
French explorers and the dearness of the soil of New York to me. I
have a particular satisfaction in being able to stand here to-night and to
introduce to you the Acting Governor of this Empire State, Governor
Conway.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Lieutenant-Governor Thomas F. Conway</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The discovery of Lake Champlain, the tercentenary of which we celebrate,
was an event of transcendent importance. Viewed from the standpoint of scenic
grandeur, this magnificent body of water with its setting of mountains, valleys and
islands, presents a picture of unrivaled beauty and sublimity unsurpassed upon the
face of the earth. Viewed from the standpoint of history, the Champlain Valley
was, from the time of its discovery until the close of the Revolution, the scene of
events of world-wide interest; events that have had an important bearing upon the
history of modern times. It was upon its shores the first battle between Champlain
and the Iroquois was fought and, according to the most authentic evidence, at this
identical spot that the plaque “La France” is to be placed. It was also upon its
shores, near Ticonderoga, that the intrepid Montcalm defeated Lord Abercromby
and, for the time, stayed the aggression of the English in their efforts to
control the destinies of the Western world. It was upon its waters the first naval
battle of the Revolution was fought, at Valcour, between Benedict Arnold, commanding
the American fleet, and Sir Guy Carleton, commanding the British
squadron. It was also upon its waters, in Plattsburgh Bay, that the last naval
battle of the war of 1812 took place between the American fleet commanded by
the brave Commodore Macdonough, and the British by the equally intrepid commander,
Downie—a battle which is now considered one of the decisive battles
of the world.</p>

<p>Its discovery, therefore, and the events surrounding and following it richly
merited its tercentenary celebration and this, its culminating and crowning feature.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Indeed, this celebration in itself is an event of striking significance. It stamps
indelibly upon the life and work of Samuel Champlain the world’s verdict. It
attests its judgment of their nobility and value and vindicates the judgment of his
contemporaries in conferring high honor and commendation upon him.</p>

<p>It demonstrates in a most impressive manner the fact that nobility of character
and unselfish devotion to ideals and purposes which lead upward and onward in
human progress, constitute the true path to immortality of fame. Actuated by a
desire to bring to the New World a knowledge of the faith, the philosophy and
the civilization of his native land, more than by motives of conquest, or to extend
its territorial dominion, he exemplified in his conduct the distinguishing traits of
the colonial policy of his nation, which then and ever since has been characterized
by a desire to confer benefits upon new subjects while acquiring dominion without
bloodshed or destruction; its recognition of the right of every people to give expression
to their ideals, their genius and their national aspirations in laws and institutions
established by themselves.</p>

<p>The influence of his example and the effect of his work have been profound
and abiding.</p>

<p>The first white man to set foot within the borders of what has become the
Empire State of the Union, he doubtless was fired with the ambition to make it
a part of New France. He found it peopled by the most powerful native tribes
inhabiting the New World.</p>

<p>The Five Nations, represented in the Long House of the Iroquois, dominated
the region, and were, and had been for more than a century thoroughly
organized for defense and aggression. Its confederation evinced political genius
of a high order. In their warfare with the Algonquians of the St. Lawrence Valley,
and other native tribes, they had made the beautiful Champlain an almost constant
scene of conflict and carnage; so much so that its fertile valleys and beautiful shores
ceased to be inhabited, except as the various warrior bands camped upon them
temporarily in their expeditions of plunder and destruction.</p>

<p>Later, in the prolonged struggles of the two greatest nations of the time, France
and England, to establish their authority and enforce their respective civilizations
upon the New World, the alliance of the Long House of the Iroquois with the
English forces determined the conflict in their favor and thus ended the effort
inaugurated by Champlain to establish the dominion of France over a large territory
of which he was the discoverer.</p>

<p>While, as a result, the civic policy of the country was thereafter dominated by
British power and influence down to the time of the Revolution, nevertheless, the
memory of the valor and the heroism of explorers like Champlain and of missionaries
like Marquette, La Salle, and their co-workers, left their enduring impress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
for good, not only upon the civilization of our State, but upon that of our whole
country.</p>

<p>For all this we owe a debt of gratitude to France, hardly less than the debt
we owe it for its unselfish and priceless assistance in our struggle for independence.</p>

<p>In the three hundred years since the discovery of the lake and region identified
with the name of Champlain, the world has witnessed a greater advance in intelligence,
in human progress, in the principle of liberty and in the recognition and
protection by governments of the rights of the ordinary man, than in any similar
period in recorded history.</p>

<p>To the intelligent observer it is evident that this advance is to-day progressing
with undiminished force on the basis of individual freedom, individual responsibility
and self-imposed restraint, which constitute the inspiration, the steadying force and
the vitalizing principle of true progress.</p>

<p>Proof of all this confronts us in every land to-day; but, as convincing and
pertinent evidence on this occasion, reference need only be made to progress in
the region with which the name and fame of Samuel Champlain are imperishably
associated.</p>

<p>I am glad that our distinguished guests from France are to visit that region and
especially the beautiful lake bearing his name, and contrast existing conditions
with the earlier scenes of savage warfare and bloodshed there enacted by the natives
prior to Champlain’s advent, and subsequently, during the struggle for supremacy
between the two great contending nations of that day.</p>

<p>We would have you see the peaceful and tranquil aspect of that beautiful lake
now with its bosom dotted with splendid steamers, the instrumentalities of pleasure
and commerce; the well equipped railroads skirting its shores, required and maintained
by the enterprise and business activities there existing; the prosperous cities,
the thriving villages, the well-kept and productive farms; the contented and happy
homes; the schools, the churches, the hospitals, the charitable organizations; in short,
every institution in which a most advanced civilization finds its best expression and
through which it performs its best and most elevating service for mankind.</p>

<p>It will enable you to better understand and appreciate the depth of our gratitude
to your great countryman and the meaning we attach to this celebration commemorating
his achievements.</p>

<p>On behalf of the state of New York and its upwards of nine millions of
inhabitants, for whom I have the privilege and honor to speak on this occasion,
I extend to our distinguished guests from France a most cordial and heartfelt
welcome.</p>

<p>And, if I may be permitted to anticipate a little, I will convey to them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
advance and, through them, to their country, the appreciation and gratitude of
our state and its people for the gift they bring and the honor they do us. It is the
conception of a great artist, admirably typifying the ideals and aspirations of a
great nation. I beg to assure you, our honored guests, that we will ever treasure
it as an expression of the good will and friendship of our sister republic—France—placing
the seal of its approval and appreciation on this celebration honoring
the achievements of Samuel Champlain.</p>

<p>In closing, permit me to say that the recollection of your visit to our state and
the motives that inspired it will ever be associated with the gift of your country,
lending to it an element of personal interest as pleasing as it will be permanent
in the minds and hearts of all who may have the privilege of meeting you during
your visit. (Applause.)</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="p1">In alluding to the Governor of Vermont, President Finley remarked:</p>

<p>The Governor of Vermont, with rare forbearance, wishes to be excused
from speaking. But as Jacques Cartier, nearly a century before the
Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, saw, first of Europeans, the peaks of
the Green mountains, so I wish you, from the land of the pilot of
St. Malo, to see the topmost peak in Vermont to-day, its Governor, the
Hon. John A. Mead.</p>

<p>Governor Mead stood and bowed to the audience. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The Toastmaster then introduced Mayor William J. Gaynor of New
York City.</p>

<p>When in the most beautiful and largest city in the southwest of France
a year ago (Bordeaux), I learned, to my surprise, that the great philosopher
and essayist, Montaigne, had been its mayor. And it is possible
that generations hence the distinction of Mr. Gaynor as Mayor may be
surpassed even by his fame as a philosopher. Certainly no man in public
life to-day is writing in his everyday letters with such pungency and
appeal on some of the problems of life, which continue to disturb
mankind.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Mayor William J. Gaynor</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am sure, said the Mayor, I am quite willing to say nothing and to write another
letter. (Laughter and applause.) This is the third time I have greeted the delegation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
from France. Once was at the City Hall and the other time was at a
luncheon at the Metropolitan Club. And I am very anxious to hear M. Hanotaux.
The coming of these gentlemen will cause us to think a great deal about what we
owe to France and to the French people.</p>

<p>You women, the Mayor added, with his eyes twinkling, might well consider the
economy of the woman of France. She knows her market prices and she goes to
market. (Laughter and applause.) I think if some of you will follow her example
the cost of living will begin to come down right away. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>There never was a time, I believe, when in the hearts of the American people
there was any danger of forgetting what we owe to France. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President Finley then presented the French delegation as follows:</p>

<p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, how shall I characterize to you the
men who constitute this notable delegation? I wish I were able to do
so in my own tongue as did Baron d’Estournelles de Constant so eloquently
a few days ago in an acquired tongue,—to tell you how this
great historian and statesman, Hanotaux, has, with an art which only a
Greek or a Frenchman could command, gathered into this company men
representing every high interest of France to carry this symbol of international
good will to our Republic and affix it to our monument, in
eternal memory of their countryman.</p>

<p>Two members of the French Academy, M. René Bazin and M.
Lamy; a foremost representative of the art of France, M. Cormon; two
members of Parliament, one already our well-beloved friend, Sénateur
Baron d’Estournelles de Constant, and M. Louis Barthou; the great
geographer, Vidal de la Blache; General Lebon; the riders of the sea
and the riders of the air; and then, the representatives of two great families
who have been especially distinguished in America’s service. What
art of selection! I must, however, be content simply to name to you the
speakers already so well introduced to you. I present first, M. Gabriel
Hanotaux.</p>

<p>M. Hanotaux responded in French, but he supplied the following
English version of his address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of His Excellency, Albert Auguste Gabrielle Hanotaux</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen.</span>—The French Delegation you have so cordially welcomed is
fully aware that this is the most important stage of its journey. For, albeit we are
going to Lake Champlain to personally place in the hands of the architects of the
monument, the bust of “La France” which is to be fixed there as a seal of friendship
and gratitude, it is here that we make the formal presentation to the Commissions
and, through them, to the world of friends which France has in the United
States.</p>

<p>Here in New York, in this Empire City, where so much of past effort and
present energy are concentrated, where five millions of human hearts beat in unison
for the greater glory and ultimate triumph of humanity, we have met with a
touching, affectionate and splendid reception which speaks to us of the warm-heartedness
of the Great American Republic.</p>

<p>From the moment we placed foot upon this soil we have been captivated and
carried away by such a whirlwind of cordiality and good-fellowship that we scarce
have had time to recover ourselves. First of all the American branches of the
Comité France-Amérique were there to receive us, and, at once, we recognized
within their ranks the eminent men who by reason of their origin, their connections
or their particularly elegant culture have linked themselves of their own accord
with our beloved France. Nothing could have touched us more than this first
reception. France, France itself before us, beyond the mighty ocean we had just
crossed under such thrilling conditions on the morrow of an awful disaster. On
the other hand, and you, gentlemen, will not, I trust, forget it, the first vessel which
came to you, after so dire a catastrophe, bearing words of comfort and hope was
named “France.”</p>

<p>Our welcome, already so touching, grew apace. Our eminent ambassador to
the United States, Monsieur Jusserand, who has given so much of his time and
taken so much trouble, to organize this mission, which he himself conceived,
informed Mr. Taft, the President of the United States, of our desire to present
to him the respectful homage of the delegation.</p>

<p>The President, despite his overwhelming occupations, received us at his table;
in the very kindest manner he honored, in our persons, the thought which has
brought us here. He was so kind as to give us personally, in connection with our
visit, assurances of his encouragement and approval; which have been for us an
ample reward. These countless acts of friendship of all kinds we have looked
upon—and rightly so—as being addressed to our beloved Mother-Country and
to the Government of the French Republic, which has so splendidly encouraged
and aided us in the accomplishment of our mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>Travelling through a part of the American continent on our way to Washington,
we were able to admire the ever-increasing progress and masterful civilization of
your Republic. We left the city of five million souls, so concentrated in its
immensity that in a manner it rises skyward upon itself; we passed through an
admirable country, looking, at this season of the year, like some great garden
dotted with cottages and shrubs and trees; we crossed majestic rivers which
evoked the finest pages of Chateaubriand, the protagonist of the French writers
of America; the steel cars carried us with prodigious speed through long tunnels
and over iron bridges which groaned beneath the onrushing train; we barely caught
sight of Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, for a space at once the citadel
and the keystone of American liberty; and we were in another city, a city beautiful,
a city verdant, whose noble proportions are worthy of the great nation of
which it is the capital, a city planned, we are proud to recall, by an officer of
the French army: Major L’Enfant. We were taken to Mount Vernon and there
we were thrilled by a greater sight than any we had yet seen: the shrine where
you cherish in the most impressive simplicity the memory of the Man whose life
was naught else than the constant blending of greatness and simplicity.</p>

<p>And, gentlemen, when on our return here we think of all this greatness, of
the endless and unceasing activity, of these wonders heaped upon wonders, when
we think of the hundred million human beings living in the United States, earning
their substance here, finding here their work, their pleasures, their luxuries and
their ideal; loving this land they themselves have created, which belongs to them
and to which they belong, proud of an admirable past, confident in a future which
gives promise of even greater things, how could our imagination fail to go back
to the men who were the first pioneers in this country, to the men who dared its
perils and wrested from it its secrets when there were no other European inhabitants.</p>

<p>The accounts of their travels depict them to us, with all their daring, with all
their perseverance, their hardships and sufferings and sacrifices; but finally with
their slow and hard-won victories over Nature and Fate.</p>

<p>We know that the first among them, fired by the discovery of mines in South
America, especially in Peru, sought only gold. Gold there was in very truth, but
not where they were looking for it. What a prodigious misunderstanding the
mirage of gold caused between this land of plenty and the men who landed here;
it cannot be exaggerated, and how little it would have been to the honor of the
human race if, at the same time, there had not been another and entirely different
mirage born of human determination and intelligence and worthy of the highest
aspirations of Man. It is an historical fact that while the conquistadores were
seeking gold and only gold, other explorers, the advance guard of science, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
conquistadores of the ideal, were sacrificing themselves to a worthier aim: the
finding of the northwest passage which around North America was to lead them
to China and India. The ones were only discovering new lands that they might
mine and impoverish them, the others that they might better know and develop them!</p>

<p>Both mirages, and illusions on both sides; but in the end practical results; so
true is it that the dream of the impossible is at times the most active instrument of
immediate and useful achievement.</p>

<p>The practical results we have before our eyes; and they came about through
the efforts of a third set of explorers whom I will now attempt to recall because
one of the most characteristic among them was our illustrious fellow-Frenchman
whose memory we are gathered here to honor, Samuel Champlain.</p>

<p>Landing on this new continent, these men were immediately struck by one thing:
to how great a degree it resembled the European countries which had given them
birth. I want to lay stress upon this point for, to their observant eyes, it was at
once a revelation and a surprise. They had to make an effort—can you believe
it—to convince themselves that they were not falling upon an imaginary and
legendary land, a land of fabulous dreams, a land of the Arabian Nights. Everything
here was like their homes and, it is literally true, they could not believe their
own eyes.</p>

<p>For you must not forget that the first accounts published about the new world
had described it as prodigious, fantastic and out of proportion to anything ever
before known. These legends were believed by the credulity of the Middle-Ages,
from which we were only just emerging, they were strengthened by the tales so
blithely told by travellers for, as the old saying has it, “falsehood is easy to one
who comes from afar.” But above all, these legends had been sunk into the
minds of men by the startling facts of the early discoveries. In the heavens</p>

<p class="pad10">
... <i lang="fr">des étoiles nouvelles</i><br>
</p>

<p>a wonderful light, the torrid climes of Central America, Nature so powerful as to
be actually deadly, the impenetrable forests, the strange vegetation, the prodigious
width of the rivers rolling to the sea, everything combined, but above all Gold,
Gold everywhere, Gold in the daily life of all, Gold in the temples, Gold on the
ground, Gold in the bowels of the earth, Gold seen and Gold unseen, that is what
exalted their overwrought imaginations to madness. It was impossible to admit
that this land could be a land like other lands. So that it needed extraordinary
common sense (if these two words may be used together), it needed an almost
miraculous self-control in these pioneers, in this third set of explorers of which I
am speaking, to forsake their preconceived notions and get down to earth again
and see that this land was after all a land just like other lands, like the lands from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
which they had sprung, loamy and fertile and fruitful, where the trees were like
European trees, with clusters of vines hanging from the branches; where wheat
grew naturally; where the fish of the rivers and sea were the same fish that they
had at home, a land where the cattle of the Mother-country waxed fat, and where
at the accustomed seasons the welcome sward stretched its mantle of green bedecked
with flowers to the very threshold of the abodes of man; where in the fall the
countryside was crowned with Gold; where the rule of life was the normal and
accustomed rule. Gold was lacking, at least the Gold so greedily sought, but on
the other hand in the soil and on the soil Gold there was in very truth and in
untold abundance, the Gold of natural wealth—a civilizing, not a destructive
Gold. I mean the Gold of labor, the Gold of human brawn, the Gold of intellect,
the Gold of inspiration, the Gold which is forever being created by the mind and
will of Man; but which was only to open up its ideal mine of surpassing wealth
after centuries of sacrifice, of labor, of tenacity, and in exchange for an immense
toll of energy.</p>

<p>These new conquistadores, the conquistadores of labor, who set their sails not
for the land of dreams, but for the land of the Things-As-They-Are, were the
real founders of the mighty civilization which surrounds us, and once again, in the
very forefront of their ranks, stands our great fellow-countryman Samuel Champlain.</p>

<p>It was not that these men were lacking in imagination, for imagination is the creative
faculty in Man, and especially so in the statesman. To do things is to see ahead.
He had indeed a wonderful imagination, a genius for foresight which was uncanny,
this extraordinary man who foretold the future of America, who pointed out the
location of the Panama Canal, who sketched the development of the great Republic
of the United States, who fixed the sites of Boston, Montreal, Quebec and so
many other great and prosperous cities. His imagination was active, yes, but his
activities were always devoted to useful achievement and love of justice.</p>

<p>He was the first to see that any colony on the American continent would have
to be self-supporting, those are his own words. He builded, he planted, he sowed
crops, he raised stockades and laid out roads, as a man relying solely upon himself.
Having shattered the flimsy phantasy of fabulous Gold he quite simply became a
farmer, a soldier, an engineer; and, when upon this land he laid the corner-stone
of the first building, he laid at the same time the foundation of a new civilization
and created an empire. Once again the nobility of labor had saved the world
from the idle vanity of dreams.</p>

<p>Labor!—There is the true basis of American civilization, as founded by those
pioneers who understood, such was their common sense, the great things that could
be done in the land where they had come to stay.—Labor, the Father of Liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the Father of Independence, the Father of Equality and of Justice; in a word the
only solid basis of Society.</p>

<p>This, then, is the characteristic—henceforth unchangeable—of your American
civilization. Everybody works, and there is work for every one and for all, but
there is no room for the idle. The ceaseless activity of your lives shows it. The
physical and mental strain to which the richest as well as the poorest of your
citizens voluntarily subject themselves proves it. A glance at your way of living
shows that you have remained faithful to the principle of your founders. The
intense activity we have witnessed during our short trip through your country, and
which we find at its highest pitch in this Empire City of New York, what is it
but a complete devotion to the duty imposed upon man by the opening words of
the Book of Books: “Thou shalt earn thy bread by the sweat of thy brow.”
Hence your incomparable greatness.</p>

<p>Blessed be Labor, gentlemen. Go on setting the example of labor to the world.
It is not Gold that counts; it is the constant and never ceasing employment of all
the faculties of Man. You have already accomplished a prodigious work,—your
future achievements will be even more extraordinary. No one can say what the
future of this continent will be when the Isthmus of Panama is cut in twain, when
the waters of the two oceans shall be joined and the coasts of the two Americas
brought together as the leaves of a closing book. It is a new source of wealth, it
is a new field of activity and a still wider field of authority and responsibility.
Between Asia and Europe your Republic certainly stands as the dividing line of
the world. You are at the fulcrum of the scale. The balance of the world’s
power will in future rest with you.</p>

<p>But now, at this very time, other problems confront you, and, first of all, let
us face it frankly, the problem of the government of the great democracies by
themselves.</p>

<p>All this stirs you, occupies your thoughts, and arouses your passions. All this
moves, deeply, those who come to visit you. To use the words of the poet of old.
They see clearly that in you is being born something greater than an Iliad:
“<i lang="la">Aliquod majus nascitur Iliade.</i>”</p>

<p>In these troublous times, gentlemen, remain true to the law of labor, to the law
of those who first planned and laid out your future life. Look back upon those
pioneers who, face to face with the early difficulties, foreseeing the growth that
was to come and how complex it was to be, bequeathed to you, in order that you
might carry out the work, a single and a simple law: the law of labor.</p>

<p>Your commemoration of Champlain, to take our modest part in which we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
crossed the ocean, proves how faithful and devoted you are to the memory of the
founders.</p>

<p>Courage, Labor, Justice, Faith in the Ideal, such the reasons for these useful
lives. We are proud that among them one of the most glorious was that of our
fellow-countryman—Champlain. We thank you for cherishing his memory.</p>

<p>And it is to show that France herself joins in these sentiments that we are come
here, in such numbers, to bring you for the Champlain monument, erected by the
States of New York and Vermont, a bust born of the genius of our illustrious
fellow-countryman Rodin, an image of that which we hold most dear: France.</p>

<p>In the mighty structure of American civilization there is something of France—allow
us to believe gentlemen that you will not forget it—and on the monument
you are erecting this image will remain forever sealed to recall and symbolize
that fact. This image we give to you as Champlain, our fellow-countryman, gave
the best of his life to this land of yours. We give it to the United States, we give
it to the States of New York and Vermont, the builders of the lighthouse rising
upon the shores of the lake which bears Champlain’s name; we give it to these
Commissions which have so graciously invited us here; we give it to all the friends
of France in America.</p>

<p>I raise my glass, gentlemen, to the Lake Champlain Association and the Tercentenary
Commissions, and I drink to the imperishable and brotherly union of
our two countries: France and America. (Long applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President Finley then presented M. Louis Barthou, who was not on
the programme, but who made a most favorable impression on all who
had the good fortune to meet him and listen to his charming eloquence.
His glowing and felicitous tribute was listened to with rapt attention.
Unfortunately his address was not reported and no copy has been
obtainable, much to the regret of all who have known him and his prominent
position in the affairs of the French Republic. At one time he was
the Minister of Justice in the Cabinet and is a noted lawyer as well as
one of the leading parliamentarians of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>President Finley then introduced Baron d’Estournelles de Constant,
who spoke in English in his usual felicitous manner in appreciation of the
reception tendered to the delegation from France and the hospitality
accorded to them in the various American cities which they had visited.
The Baron is well known in America, where he has advocated International<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Peace, and spoke in terms of affection of his friends in America
and what they were doing to promote International Peace. It is a matter
of regret that his speech was not reported in full so that it could be
included in this Final Report.</p>

<p>President Finley then introduced Senator Henry W. Hill, the Secretary
of the New York Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commission, who
on behalf of the two Commissions received the gift of the people of
France and expressed the cordial feelings of appreciation with which the
beautiful and appropriate bust is received in the following address:</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Senator Henry W. Hill</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Ambassador Jusserand, Your Excellency Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux, and
other Members of the Delegation from France, and Gentlemen of the New York
and Vermont Tercentenary Commissions, and of the New York Champlain Association</em>:
This is a fitting postlude to the Bi-State programme of International Tercentenary
exercises in commemoration of the discovery of one of the most charming
lakes in America by the brave and high-minded Samuel Champlain, who believed
that “the salvation of one soul is of more value than the conquest of an enemy.”
The light of civilization impersonated in his entrance into the Champlain valley and
thus first gleaming through the darkness of savagery is to be symbolized in a
memorial lighthouse erected by the states of New York and Vermont on property
of the United States Government at Crown Point Forts, that location being for
150 years one of the strategic points of the French possessions in America, and the
life work of the discoverer is to be further perpetuated by an heroic size statue by
the New York sculptor, Carl Augustus Heber, at Plattsburgh. The people of the
two States in grateful appreciation of the life, services and high moral character
of the discoverer of the lake which bears his name, and who was the first white
man to set foot on the soil of New York and Vermont, eleven years before the
Pilgrims entered Plymouth Bay, and two months before Henry Hudson discovered
the river bearing his name, flowing into this beautiful harbor of New York,
conceived and carried forward the Champlain Tercentenary Celebration of 1909,
which has awakened deep interest in the principles and common purposes of two
Republics, and done much to strengthen the friendship between them, that prompted
France to shed across the seas its kindly and beneficent influence upon this Republic
in its infancy. In the conduct of that Tercentenary now considered as one of the
most noted American commemorative celebrations, the Republic of France represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
by its gifted and eloquent patriot and scholar, Ambassador Jusserand, the
Kingdom of Great Britain by its distinguished Ambassador Right Honorable James
Bryce, the Dominion of Canada by its noted Postmaster-General Lemieux, the
Province of Quebec by its gifted Premier Sir Lomer Gouin, the Empire of Japan
by its Vice-Admiral, Uriu, and the United States by its President and Secretary
of War, and some members of its Senate and House of Representatives, and representatives
of the Army and Navy, participated with the States of New York and
Vermont, and thus gave it an international character, worthy the important events
which it was designed to commemorate.</p>

<p>You would be likely to form a more adequate conception of the magnitude of
the Tercentenary Celebration, if you were to picture the Champlain valley, one
hundred miles in length, and twenty-five miles in width, with the lake, as stated
by Dr. Cady, “a prismed pendant dropped from out the skies,” interspersed with
beautiful islands, and buttressed by prominent headlands, as an arena with overtowering
mountains on either side, forming a background of superb natural beauty
and suggesting ideals of the true and sublime in nature and a sky of Italian beauty
vaulting a lake of crystal waters, where five great scenes were presented to thronging
thousands of interested spectators—one at Crown Point which projects into
the lake so far as nearly to sever it into two sections, where was erected at vast
expenditure of money, in 1731, by the French, Fort Frédéric, in honor of the
French Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Frédéric Maurepas, under the supervision of
the Marquis de Beauharnois, Governor-General of Canada, and later were also
erected the English forts by the forces under General Amherst, the forts now forming
a grand ruin; another scene twenty miles distant, on the following day, at
Ticonderoga, “the Gateway of the Nation,” where was built Fort Carillon, in
1755-6, around which struggled the flower of contending armies of three
sovereign nations for its control; another scene, sixty miles distant, at Plattsburgh
Barracks, on a plateau overlooking Valcour Island, where occurred one of
the chief naval engagements of the Revolution, the report of which electrified
the Continental Congress, and also overlooking Plattsburgh Bay, where occurred
the decisive naval engagement of the War of 1812, in which the American
fleet under Macdonough defeated and routed the British fleet under Downie;
and still another scene twenty-five miles distant, on the following day, in the
city of Burlington, under the shadow of the university which had been burned
during the War of 1812, and whose corner-stone was relaid by Marquis de
Lafayette in 1825, and where stands a statue erected to his memory, on a sloping
hillside overlooking Burlington Bay, that beautiful Baiae of our inland sea, and the
clear waters of the historic lake walled in on the west by the rugged and occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
snow-capped peaks of the Adirondacks; and the fifth scene, forty-five miles
distant, on the following day, at beautiful Isle La Motte, which was the first land
in the Champlain valley visited by Samuel Champlain, which had been for two
centuries or more the common meeting place of warring Indian tribes, and which
became the rendezvous of missionaries, and where in 1666, was built Fort Ste.
Anne, and where High Mass was first celebrated in the State of Vermont, and
where was stationed the Carignan-Salières Regiment of 600 French veterans. At
each of these scenes were Indian pageants, moved from place to place on a floating
island, participated in by 150 descendants of the native aboriginal tribes that occupied
the Champlain valley, and enlivened by military and naval forces, with
formal addresses, speeches and poems, by the President of the United States and
the distinguished diplomats, orators and poets in attendance, presenting anew the
story and thrilling events that have transpired in the Champlain valley since its
discovery three centuries ago. This will afford some conception of the great drama
of the Champlain Tercentenary Celebration, in which Samuel Champlain, the
navigator, colonizer and apostle of civilization in that valley, <i lang="fr">Chevalier sans peur
et sans reproche</i>, was the hero and central figure.</p>

<p>On this occasion we are profoundly touched at the generosity and friendship of
President Fallières and the French people, exhibited in the presentation by the distinguished
delegation who have come from France, of this allegorical bust “La
France,” by Auguste Rodin, and we gratefully accept the same in the name of
the New York and Vermont Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions, in behalf
of the people of the two states, as well as of the people of the United States, and
through you, Monsieur Hanotaux, and other members of your delegation from
France, we tender to President Fallières and the people of France, who have so
generously contributed to the purchase and presentation of this beautiful bust, our
grateful appreciation and acknowledgments.</p>

<p>This work of art, coming as a voluntary expression of the good will and cordial
feelings of the French people for Americans who have shown some appreciation of
the discoveries and services for humanity of one of the most noted French explorers
among many, who were first to open up the interior of this continent to the onward
march of civilization, is an imperishable testimonial of that abiding friendship existing
between the peoples of the two foremost Republics in the world, which have
done so much for the liberty, equality and fraternity of mankind. When we
reflect upon the evolution of French institutions from Charlemagne to Fallières, the
progress of the French people in the arts and sciences within the last century, and
the contributions that they have made to these, and to literature and to art, as well
as to the world’s diplomacy and intellectual development, we do not wonder that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the Republic across the sea, which you represent, gentlemen, is aglow with vitality
and energized by new and expanding ideas, and is forging forward as one of the
most progressive and powerful nations in the world. Had not the French people
been open to new ideas, possibly they would not have responded to the appeals of
Franklin and our other patriots during the Revolution, and the Marquis de Lafayette,
Count de Rochambeau, with his 6,000 soldiers, Count de Grasse, with his
fleet, and others, would not have crossed the Atlantic to aid the Colonies in their
struggle for independence.</p>

<p>Lafayette and others carried back with them something of the inspiration which
they had derived from their experience in this country and from their contact with
General Washington and other patriots, and their reports did something to arouse
the National Assembly of France, and the princes and potentates of European
nations to a realization of the evidences of the Republican movement in America
as well as in Europe, which culminated in making most of the nations of western
Europe more democratic and responsive to popular liberties. On the establishment
of a Republican form of government in France in 1848, the President of the
United States transmitted a message to Congress, in which he said: “We can
never forget that France was our early friend in our eventful Revolution, and
generously aided us in shaking off a foreign yoke and becoming a free and independent
people. We have enjoyed the blessing of our system of well regulated
self-government for nearly three-fourths of a century, and can properly appreciate
its value. Our ardent and sincere congratulations are extended to the patriotic
people of France upon their noble and thus far successful efforts to found for
their future government liberal institutions similar to our own. It is not doubtful
that under the benign influence of free institutions the enlightened statesmen of
Republican France will find it to be for her true interests and permanent glory to
cultivate with the United States the most liberal principles of international intercourse
and commercial reciprocity, whereby the happiness and prosperity of both
nations will be promoted.” A fitting response to this was made by the National
Assembly of France, and there have from that time forth existed cordial relations
between the two sister Republics. These relations were emphasized in the presentation
by the French people of the colossal statue “Liberty Enlightening the World,”
by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, unveiled with elaborate ceremonies on Bedloe’s
Island in New York harbor, on October 28, 1886. When the Rodin allegorical
bust “La France” is in its permanent home by the Champlain Memorial Light at
the Crown Point Forts near the head of Lake Champlain, it will be on the highway
of travel by water between New York harbor and Lake Champlain, through
the enlarged and improved Champlain Canal nearing completion, and so be brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
into communication with the statue of Liberty, and will do something to restore
the interest of travelers as well as of our French-American citizens, in the history
of that region, for 150 years under control of the French nation, and within a
few miles of which at Ticonderoga, Montcalm and others achieved imperishable
fame, and will be a further lasting expression of the artistic temperament and proverbial
generosity of the French people toward the people of this nation, the
genius of whose institutions has been more or less reflected in the evolution of
French institutions during the last century. As an expression of one of your most
renowned sculptors, it will awaken a deeper interest of the people in that valley
in art, which has been ideally expressed in this allegorical bust “La France,” in a
way to symbolize the marvelous genius of the French people.</p>

<p>The members of New York and Vermont Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions
bid you, gentlemen of the French delegation, a most cordial welcome to
our shores, and tender to you their deep appreciation of the gift which you bring
from your people. (Applause.)</p>

<h3 id="PartI_V">V. FRENCH DELEGATION ENTERTAINED BY THE
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">On May 2d, The Chamber of Commerce of the State of New
York entertained at luncheon the French delegation in the Hall
of the Chamber on Liberty street, New York City. Ambassador
Jusserand and the visiting delegation and other invited guests were presented
to President A. Barton Hepburn by Hon. McDougall Hawkes
and then seated on the dais. The flags of the United States and France
were entwined behind the President’s chair.</p>

<p>In welcoming the distinguished visitors, President A. Barton Hepburn
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When this country was struggling to win a place in the sisterhood of nations,
without facilities for manufacturing the necessary means for defense, or money to
purchase the same, at war with one of the most powerful nations of Europe,
supplemented by the inspired hostility of the then powerful tribes of surrounding
Indians, poor in purse, rich only in patriotic resolve to win their freedom, with
credit shrouded by the gloom of possible, if not probable failure—at this critical
juncture France came to our support, with soldiers and ships of war, and rendered
the greatest aid in winning our independence.</p>

<p>In addition, France loaned us money. The amount was not large, indeed it
was small, compared with present day loans or transactions, but the loan was
made at a time when our continental currency was so depreciated, that it has
given to our language an expression of worthlessness,—“not worth a continental.”</p>

<p>It was real, metallic money, and the ring of that money resounded throughout
the colonies; it strengthened credit and renewed confidence. It was tangible
evidence that a great nation believed in us—believed in our future.</p>

<p>At the Battle of Yorktown, which was the crowning victory that assured our
independence, France furnished thirty-six ships of the line—the colonies none;
of the land forces engaged, France furnished 7,000 veterans—the colonies 5,500
regulars and 3,500 militia. The French fleet, under De Grasse, had previously
defeated the British fleet and driven them from the Chesapeake, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
depriving Cornwallis of all hope of reinforcements from New York, and also
cutting off all hope of escape.</p>

<p>We won our independence, but in our self-gratulation, let us not forget the
magnitude of the service, and the extent of our obligation to France. Hostility
to England, as well as love for America, may have inspired her action, but even
so, it does not lessen the service rendered to us.</p>

<p>This powerful alliance kindled anew the fires of patriotism, and roused a countrywide
feeling of gratitude and love for France, which has ever since continued.
May this feeling grow in intensity with succeeding years!</p>

<p>God grant that these two great commercial nations may find prosperity and
happiness in the paths of peace, and side by side, shoulder to shoulder, may their
joint influence make for peace and happiness throughout the world. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I have read that the figure upon the coins of France—a woman sowing—symbolizes
the idea that France sows while others reap. That is eminently true of
the United States and eminently true of North America. When we recall that
Canada, the Ohio territory and Louisiana once belonged to France, and recall how
relatively small the Spanish province of Florida and the British colonies along the
Atlantic Coast were, we realize what an empire on this continent, extending from
the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico, was once the territory of France.</p>

<p>Her intrepid explorers, her patient priests and devoted missionaries sowed the
seeds of civilization in this great territory, and the harvest of their labors we are
reaping year by year.</p>

<p>The magnificent statue of Liberty, that ornaments and dignifies our harbor—the
creation of a great French artist and sculptor—Bartholdi—was a gift from
France.</p>

<p>Our guests visit this country at the present time to place a bas-relief, “La
France”—the creation of another great French artist and sculptor—Rodin—upon
a monument erected by the states of New York and Vermont, at Crown
Point Forts, in memory of the great explorers in this western world, chief among
whom ranks Champlain.</p>

<p>Our country was born amid the martial airs and chivalric heroism of the arms
of France, and consecrated with the blood of her soldiers and sailors, and ever
since she has given continuing proof of her friendship, both actual and sentimental—witness
the presence of this distinguished delegation.</p>

<p>Surely our hearts ought to go out to France, as they do, in reciprocal good will,
and our prayers be offered, as they are, for her peace, prosperity and
happiness.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure and privilege for the commercial representatives of this state to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
receive and welcome you gentlemen, and I appeal to your kindly imagination to
conceive the cordial greetings which we all feel, but which my language fails to
express. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President Hepburn then introduced the French Ambassador, J. J.
Jusserand, who spoke eloquently on the importance of the extension of
the commercial relations between France and the United States and also
in appreciation of the hospitality shown in this country to the French
delegation, comprising distinguished officials and civilians from the
Republic of France.</p>

<p>President Hepburn then presented His Excellency, Gabriel Hanotaux
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He has won fame as a statesman and as a scholar. For
many years he was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of
France, and in the world of letters has achieved that most enviable distinction—a
member of the French Academy. I have the pleasure of
presenting M. Gabriel Hanotaux.”</p>
</div>

<p>M. Hanotaux was greeted with loud applause and spoke in French.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of M. Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux</h4>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p><em>Monsieur le Président</em>: Si je jette les yeux autour de moi, ma pensée et celle
de la délégation tout entière se porte vers les énergies humaines que vous
représentez autour de nous. C’est la puissance des États-Unis d’Amérique, c’est
cette activité inlassable qui a couvert de ses oeuvres et de ses conquêtes un continent
et la planète entière se détournant de ses travaux pour nous faire un splendide
et chaleureux accueil. Cette réunion, ces fleurs, ces drapeaux, tout se réunit pour
faire sentir à la France combien elle est chère à cette vaillante cité new yorkaise.
Mais <ins class="corr" id="tn-61" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'il y quelque'">
il y a quelque</ins> chose de plus chaud et de plus précieux dans l’accueil que vous
nous faites, c’est le mouvement du coeur. Comment vous exprimer notre
reconnaissance?</p>

<p>D’ailleurs n’est-ce pas la générosité américaine qui a déterminé le voyage de la
Délégation française?</p>

<p>Il y a quelques mois notre éminent ambassadeur, Monsieur Jusserand, qui veille
avec tant de compétence à tout ce qui peut rapprocher les deux pays, nous avait
signalé la prochaine érection sur les bords du lac Champlain d’un monument en<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
l’honneur de notre vaillant compatriote. Il pensait avec raison que la France ne
pouvait rester indifférente à ce beau geste qui en continue tant d’autres analogues.
Mais comment la France manifesterait-elle sa gratitude, comment participerait-elle
à cette glorification d’un de ses enfants?</p>

<p>Seul, un appel au public et un appel à l’art pouvaient avoir une portée suffisante
pour répondre. Par les soins du comité France-Amérique que nous représentons
ici, les deux manifestations simultanées se sont produites: le public français a compris
et a rapidement souscrit les listes en tête desquelles il trouvait le nom vénéré de
Monsieur Fallières, Président de la République Française. En même temps l’art
avait fait son oeuvre, et le sculpteur Rodin avait conçu et exécuté l’image de la
“France” que nous avions sollicitée de son génie.</p>

<p>C’est cette image que nous avons apportée ici pour qu’elle soit scellée au pied
du monument de Champlain, comme un cachet et un sceau authentiquant une fois
de plus la fidélité de nos sentiments communs et nos souvenirs.</p>

<p>Vous avez bien voulu arrêter au passage dans cette grande ville la délégation
qui va porter le bronze au lieu où il est destiné! Vous savez qu’elle appartient
aux diverses grandes institutions et corporations françaises, au Parlement, à l’Académie
et à l’Institut, à l’Armée, à l’Université, au Conseil d’État, à l’Industrie, au
Commerce, et qu’elle contient trois membres descendant des familles qui ont combattu
ou servi à l’époque de la guerre de l’Indépendance, Choiseul, Rochambeau,
Lafayette, dont nous avons ici le petit-fils, le Comte de Chambrun. Celui-ci a reçu,
en outre, une délégation spéciale de M. le Président du Conseil, Monsieur Raymond
Poincaré, et il le représente personnellement.</p>

<p>Ainsi, par-dessus les Océans, une même pensée nous unit. Les États-Unis élèvent
un monument à un Français. La France vous envoie, par nous, son tribut de
gratitude: une fois de plus les deux grandes démocraties pensent et agissent à
l’unisson.</p>

<p>Je ne veux pas tenter <ins class="corr" id="tn-62" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'ici un parellèle'">
ici un parallèle</ins> presque impossible entre les deux Républiques,
l’une vaste, puissante, jeune, pleine d’élan et de grandeur, l’autre plus à l’étroit
sur son territoire resserré dans la vieille Europe, mais elle aussi, active et toujours
jeune, éprise d’action, amante de la beauté, apportant à la réalisation de son idéal
la plus noble culture peut-être qu’il y ait au monde, puisqu’elle remonte à deux
mille ans en arrière <ins class="corr" id="tn-62a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'aux temps aù César'">
aux temps où César</ins> conquit la Gaule et où le Christ naquit.
Ce qui caractérise toutefois les relations toujours cordiales et toujours fidèles de ces
deux pays, c’est que, se développant parallèlement, ils ne se heurtent nulle part.
Je crois exprimer un fait réel, à la fois très simple et très fort, en disant, qu’entre la
France et les États-Unis d’Amérique, il y a plus d’aptitude à se connaître et à se
comprendre qu’entre deux autres pays du monde, quels qu’ils soient.</p>

<p>Et, si l’on me demande pourquoi, je répondrai en employant la formule d’une<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
des proclamations de la Nouvelle-Angleterre, avant la guerre de l’Indépendance,
parce que ce sont deux pays “où l’on ne connaît ni suzerains, ni seigneurs, ni princes,
mais seulement le peuple.”</p>

<p>Tout donc porte les deux Républiques à l’entente et à l’union: des souvenirs
communs, un objectif pareil, une conception semblable de la vie publique. La République
américaine et la République française sont les deux filles aînées de la
liberté. 1787, l’année de la Constitution américaine et 1789, l’année qui inaugure
l’ère moderne en France, ce sont deux grandes dates de nos histoires, et deux grandes
dates de l’histoire du monde.</p>

<p>Avec un point de départ presque simultané, les deux pays out suivi leurs voies
diverses, l’un occupé à se saisir d’un territoire immense, pliant aux nécessités de cette
vie énorme et dispersée ses institutions à la fois fédéralistes et unitaires, ouvrant au
vieux monde un asile tutélaire et développant sur son sol, grâce à cet afflux permanent
du trop plein des forces humaines, une civilisation qui est l’héritière de toutes
les civilisations; l’autre plus unitaire et plus centralisé; plus ramassé et plus fondu,
plus traditionnel, mais plus alourdi par le poids du passé, travaillant à faire entrer,
dans ses vieux cadres historiques, les puissances d’énergie que la vie moderne exige
des sociétés qui veulent garder leur place et leur rang dans la grande famille humaine.</p>

<p>Après cent ans de cet effort parallèle, les voici donc qui apparaissent toutes deux
en pleine possession de leur valeur, et avec la conscience de ce qu’elles sont et de
ce qu’elles doivent être. N’est-ce pas le moment pour elles deux de se considérer
mutuellement et de s’apercevoir, une fois pour toutes, que dans cette marche parallèle,
elles se complètent souvent et ne se contrarient jamais?</p>

<p>Puisque je parle ici devant les représentants les plus autorisés du commerce
américain, il me paraît facile de prendre le commerce en exemple.</p>

<p>Le commerce est entre les peuples le premier et le plus indispensable des biens.
Qui dit commerce dit bon vouloir réciproque, confiance mutuelle et paix. Il est
incontestable, qu’à l’origine de toutes les civilisations <ins class="corr" id="tn-63" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'se trouvre le'">
se trouve le</ins> <em>commerce</em>, et quand
les premiers navigateurs européens, à commencer par le plus grand de tous, Christophe
Colomb,—ont été vers l’Occident à la recherche des terres nouvelles, que
prétendaient-ils, sinon trouver des chemins et des débouchés nouveaux? C’est du
commerce qu’on peut dire avec raison “<span lang="la">Mens agitat molem</span>.”</p>

<p>Or, précisément, dans le commerce franco-américain, une heureuse entente de
nos intérêts réciproques nous conduit à cette conviction que, là aussi, bien peu de
choses nous séparent, tandis que beaucoup nous rapprochent. L’Amérique produit
en abondance des matières premières dont notre industrie a besoin; la France produit
des substances alimentaires, et des articles où se distingue spécialement le goût
français, et dont le luxe croissant des Amériques aura sans doute toujours besoin.
Sur ces bases, les conditions d’une harmonie bien équilibrée peuvent sans trop de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
difficultés se dégager. Aussi voyons nous que la France est de toutes les nations
de l’Europe (l’Angleterre exceptée), celle qui fait le plus d’affaires avec les États-Unis
proportionnellement au chiffre de sa population et à l’étendue de son territoire,
confirmant ainsi l’observation que je faisais tout à l’heure, à savoir que les lois de
l’histoire doivent combiner nos efforts, et que, seule, une erreur inexcusable pourrait
les séparer.</p>

<p>C’est pour étendre et appliquer cette opinion,—j’irai jusqu’à dire cette doctrine,—que
le comité France-Amérique s’est fondé à Paris, et qu’il est venu devant
vous pour travailler au développement des bonnes relations si heureusement existantes
entre les deux pays. Dans tous les ordres de manifestations cordiales, on nous
trouve et on nous trouvera. C’est là notre rôle et nous le revendiquons hautement.</p>

<p>Relations économiques, relations intellectuelles, relations sociales, relations artistiques,
dans tous ces ordres d’idées, nous travaillons dans le même sens et c’est à
cette initiative de notre part que nous vous prions de répondre par des sentiments
et des actes analogues. Nous sommes venus vers vous; venez vers nous à votre tour.</p>

<p>On dit, de la pensée américaine, qu’elle se formule en termes d’action “to think
in terms of action.” Eh bien! nous, nous avons formulé notre sentiment en termes
d’action, en venant vingt bons compagnons j’ose le dire, appartenant aux diverses
activités françaises, vous apporter pour une grande commémoration, une chose
éminemment française, une <em>oeuvre d’art</em>.</p>

<p>Nous avons mûrement réfléchi avant de prendre ce parti et nous vous prions d’y
réfléchir à votre tour. Nous n’avons aucun titre officiel; nous sommes de simples
particuliers, mais nous nous sommes choisis (si vous me permettez cette expression
ambitieuse) dans le désir de ne pas être trop indignes de vous et de votre confiance.</p>

<p>Il y eut un temps où pour la découverte des pays transatlantiques, les premiers
pionniers sont partis volontairement de nos rivages: Champlain fut le plus glorieux
parmi ces Français: ceux-là étaient <em>les volontaires de la foi et de l’espérance</em>. Il
fut un temps où d’autres volontaires partirent pour servir une cause juste et légitime:
ceux-là furent <em>les volontaires de la Liberté et de l’Indépendance</em>. Les temps sont
changés; les grandes oeuvres sont accomplies. Cependant, nous aussi nous venons
spontanément, pour maintenir, du moins, ce qu’ont fait nos aïeux, et nous sommes
<em>les volontaires de l’Amitié</em>.</p>

<p>Comment cette amitié qui est un sentiment et qui est la fleur de l’âme s’exprimerait-elle
mieux que par une oeuvre d’art, c’est-à-dire la fleur du goût et du génie
humain?</p>

<p>L’art, en effet, est l’essence du travail des siècles et ses oeuvres seules survivent
aux siècles. Une civilisation achevée s’exprime par l’art: l’art résume toujours ce
que l’humanité sent et pense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>Par quoi connaît-on la grandeur de l’âme artistique, sinon par les monuments
artistiques, l’Egypte, la Grèce, Rome, le Moyen-Age nous ont transmis leur pensée
par cette langue universelle et immortelle qui s’appelle l’art. Ce que l’humanité
veut faire connaître d’elle-même à l’avenir, elle le confie à l’art.</p>

<p>Et c’est pourquoi, comme un symbole de l’amitié franco-américaine, nous avons
choisi une belle oeuvre d’art due à notre grand sculpteur Rodin.</p>

<p>A bord d’un bâtiment nouveau et qui s’appelle “La France,” une délégation
française est venue pour vous remercier de célébrer un Français.</p>

<p>Par la pensée, par le commerce, par le goût du grand, du beau, du juste, par
une foi identique dans la paix entre les hommes, les deux grandes démocraties que
l’Océan seul sépare, sont faites pour s’aimer, se comprendre et s’unir.</p>

<p>Nous demandons aux Chambres de Commerce américaines de seconder l’oeuvre
d’union que nous avons enterprise.</p>

<p>Merci aux Chambres de Commerce américaines. A tout jamais prospérité,
grandeur, bonheur et gloire, à la grande République des États-Unis d’Amérique!
(Loud applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President Hepburn introduced the next speaker as follows: There
are few homes in this country in which the benign face of Washington
does not look down upon the family activities. Serious contemplation of
the face of Washington must soon bring into perspective the face of that
great Frenchman with whom he was so closely associated, whom he so
highly esteemed, Lafayette. We are fortunate in having with us to-day
a direct descendant of the great Lafayette, his great-great-grandson.
He is upon this delegation as the personal representative of the Premier
of the present government of France. I take great pleasure in presenting
Count de Chambrun.</p>

<p>Count de Chambrun spoke in English.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Count de Chambrun</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Mr. President and Gentlemen</em>: The very character of the present solemnities
which have brought this delegation to America awakens with us in France a
peculiar feeling of sympathy and grateful retrospection. Our intellectual world,
our literary men—all who are versed in historical research and who cherish the
great memories of the past—look back with love and pride upon the one time
humble heroes whose venturous spirit and whose wonderful foresight made of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
own mother country the glorious promoter of civilization. Indeed, the ties uniting
France and America have always been popular with us, and our public men have
ever justly prized their great and valuable importance; but, in the present instance,
the Prime Minister of the French Republic has desired to be personally represented.
He, also, a patriot and a man of letters, cannot refrain from emotion when he
recalls that page of our common history, when a countryman of ours with scanty
means, but with vast courage and genius opened new lands and new prospects to
the achievements of humanity.</p>

<p>And this is why M. Raymond Poincaré wishes that his own tribute should not
be lacking where honors are bestowed upon our brave Champlain; it is my good
fortune, gentlemen, to be the bearer of this heartfelt tribute in memory of the early
traveller now famous among our great explorers.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, at different stages, it has been the destiny of Frenchmen to
play on this proud continent a decisive part in the interest of the world’s progress.
Whether as pioneers in the northern and western dominions, at a remote period
when these lands were yet unknown, or later on, in time of need, when the United
States sought freedom and independence, was it not Frenchmen who came again
with helping swords in a new American cause, where, as volunteers and soldiers,
their hearts became enlisted.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, we citizens of France do not forget that it was upon
your virgin soil that free institutions were first sown of which we in turn were able
to fully harvest.</p>

<p>The declaration of the American Independence preceded the declaration of the
Rights of Man, and Republican Government in America preceded the establishment
of Free Government in France.</p>

<p>Mutual action at decisive moments, as we see, has blended together the histories
of France and of the United States with ever beneficial effect, leaving to-day in
the hearts of both nations an unparalleled feeling of esteem and constantly well-wishing
affection. (Great applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President Hepburn said: “Only a few years ago we wanted the
world, but now we want the air above it. We have with us to-day one of
the pioneers in navigation of the air, the man who first crossed the English
channel in a heavier than air machine. I present to you M. Louis
Blériot.” M. Blériot said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He had been carried away on the wings of the eloquence to heights
where it was imprudent for an aviator to risk himself, and he would express<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
simply, but with profound sincerity in behalf of French industry the great admiration
which they, the workmen of old Europe, had for the great and daring efforts
of America to conquer the air. That work brought men together, and united
especially the citizens of America and France, already brothers by ancient bonds.
Thanks to science and industry, distances were diminishing. They admired Edison
and did not forget Fulton, as they recollected all those who had contributed by
their invention or their initiative to widen the field of the activity of humanity. He
looked forward to the time when the birds of France and the birds of America
would settle on each others’ shores. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>Addresses were also made in French by M. Louis Barthou, formerly
a member of the French Cabinet, and others. They were enthusiastically
received. At the luncheon which followed the meeting a toast was given
in honor of the President of France which was responded to by
M. Hanotaux, after which Baron D’Estournelles de Constant made an
eloquent address. Since their return to France and the election of
M. Raymond Poincaré to the Presidency of that Republic, M. Louis
Barthou has been made President of the Council of Ministers. It is
very gratifying to the many friends in America of M. Barthou that he
has been so signally honored by the French nation.</p>

ENTERTAINED AT TICONDEROGA,
LATER INSPECT CHAMPLAIN MEMORIAL
LIGHTHOUSE AT CROWN POINT, WHERE
THEY FORMALLY PLACE THE BUST “LA
FRANCE” AND THEN JOURNEY TO PLATTSBURGH.
REPORT TO PARIS</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The members of the New York and Vermont Lake Champlain
Commissions accompanied by His Excellency, M. Jusserand,
the French Ambassador, Governor Mead of Vermont and the
members of the French delegation left New York on the night train,
May 2d, in special cars, which were detached from the train the next
morning at Fort Ticonderoga station. The French visitors were entertained
at breakfast by Mr. and Mrs. Stephen H. P. Pell at “The
Pavilion,” their summer home, while the members of the Joint Commissions
were entertained at breakfast by Commissioner Howland Pell
in the Block House, rebuilt by him in the Germain Redoubt overlooking
the Lake. Several hours were spent in looking over the ruins, fortifications
and restorations, the details of which were explained by Mr. and
Mrs. Stephen H. P. Pell, who own Fort Ticonderoga and Mount
Independence. The visitors were greatly interested in all they saw, and
especially the French lines, the scene of Montcalm’s victory in 1758 and
the place where the battle occurred. The ancient flag of France with the
Fleur-de-lis was displayed together with the Tri-color and each was
saluted with formality.</p>

<p>Members of the delegation and Ambassador Jusserand called on
Commissioner Pell at the Block House in the Germain Redoubt, where
light refreshments were served.</p>

<p>General Lebon and other members of the delegation were quick to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the strategic importance of Ticonderoga as a military fortification to
command the passage of vessels up and down the lake as well as the
passage of troops through the valley. In their judgment France made
no mistake in taking possession of Ticonderoga and taking her stand
there and at Crown Point in her efforts to control this entire territory.
The history of the struggle has been graphically described by Parkman
and others and the thrilling events, culminating in and about this
“Gateway of the Country,” have been given realistic settings by Ira
Allen, Hon. Lucius E. Chittenden, Rev. Joseph Cook, Dr. Hamilton
W. Mabie, Percy MacKaye and others. These were well known to
most of the visiting savants, who were profoundly impressed with Ticonderoga
and the overtowering Mount Defiance on the southwest and the
commanding position of Mount Independence across the narrow lake
on the southeast. All these were occupied by military forces at times
during the struggle for the control of the territory.</p>

<p>The Commissioners and visitors left on a special train at 11.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>
for Port Henry, where they were met by Commissioner Walter C. Witherbee,
Hon. Frank S. Witherbee, Lieut.-Gov. Thomas F. Conway and
others. While going from Ticonderoga to Port Henry, lunch was
served on the train, so that upon their arrival at Port Henry, while
they were being escorted to the steamer, the Witherbee band played the
Marseillaise, and to the delight of the French guests, it also played the
airs of several French folk songs familiar to the visitors and known
to their grandparents. They proceeded directly to Crown Point Forts.
This was their first experience on Lake Champlain, their first view of
the memorial in the process of construction. It was far enough along,
however, to reveal its stateliness and artistic design. The impression it
made on M. Fernand Cormon, President of the French Academy,
and on M. René Bazin, M. Étienne Lamy, M. Gabriel Hanotaux and
other members of the French Academy may be drawn from the remarks
of M. Hanotaux and others. Suffice it to say here that the visitors were
pleased with the artistic memorial lighthouse, which, in addition to its
utilitarian uses, is designed to symbolize the illumination of the light of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
civilization first shed in the valley by Champlain and his followers.
After inspecting the memorial they suggested the permanent location for
the bust “La France,” which had been temporarily placed in position
and was inspected by the people from all parts of the Champlain valley.
The bust was draped with the flags of the United States and the Tri-color
of France and from all parts of the memorial lighthouse floated
pennants and the Stars and Stripes in profusion.</p>

in his opening address said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Gentlemen</em>: The course of the Tercentenary observations has received an
interruption by a voice from across the sea. It is a friendly voice. It is a voice
that is heard wherever men struggle to be free or seek to advance their welfare.
It is the voice of France that spoke to us in the dark days of our early history,
and bade us be of good cheer.</p>

<p>All through the critical periods of our history the French people and their Government
have been our friends. They join us to-day in memorializing our past.
They have the right to do so, for France and America have suffered and triumphed
together for the same high cause and the memory of our debt to this liberty-loving
people can never be forgotten. It is fitting that they place the Memorial Tablet
here. It expresses to us love and friendship and they may be assured that we will
guard it with proud and zealous care.</p>
</div>

<p>I now take great pleasure in introducing to you the acting Governor,
Lieutenant-Governor Conway.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Gov. Thomas F. Conway in the course of his address of
welcome said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Gentlemen</em>: I had the pleasure on Wednesday evening of extending to you on
the part of the State of New York the appreciation of its citizens at your coming
to our shores, but it is a double pleasure to welcome you to Lake Champlain, rich
in French history and the pride of every one who may rightfully claim the Champlain
valley as his birthplace. We believe that you will find this one of the most
charming lakes you have ever visited and we trust that you will appreciate its
beauties as do its inhabitants and its many visitors.</p>
</div>

<p>Chairman Knapp then introduced Gov. John A. Mead of Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>Governor Mead in welcoming the visitors said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people of the Green Mountain State join with the people of the Empire
State in welcoming the members of the distinguished delegation from France who
have come to bring the seal of the Mother-Country to the memorial of one of
her most distinguished sons. The Vermont Commission in order to do honor to
that distinguished son, Samuel Champlain, united with the New York Commission
in erecting this stately joint memorial to commemorate his memory, which is revered
by the people of both states. We count it the greatest privilege that can fall to
the lot of any man to be born along the shores of this beautiful lake, which Champlain
considered worthy to bear his name.</p>
</div>

<p>Chairman Knapp then presented the French delegation, saying: Many
Commissions have come from France to us, but all of France has never
been so well represented as it is by our guests to-day. They bring in
their hands the gift that has been contributed by all the classes of all the
French people.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of introducing to you the Chairman of the
Delegation, M. Gabriel Hanotaux.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The states of Vermont and New York raise this monument, torch-bearer to
the glory of the first Europeans who saw their territories and who foresaw their
future prosperity. A French delegation has come to thank the constructors of this
magnificent monument and to seal upon its base, as a sign of gratitude, an image
of France.</p>

<p>This work of one of our greatest sculptors, Rodin, is of modest size, but it certainly
expresses well what we have wished to say; it will bear testimony among
you of the quality of French taste; it will depict to you France, such as we Frenchmen
conceive it, such as we love it. See this countenance, smiling and at the same time
grave, these delicate and pure features, these full cheeks indicating health, this firm
look expressing resolution and sincerity. It is France as she wishes to be and
as she is.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">French Delegation and Commissioners at Crown Point Memorial, May 3, 1912</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The France of the Crusades, the France of Joan of Arc, of Louis XIV and
of Napoleon, of the Revolution, the France of the Richelieus and of the Champlains,
that France cannot forget those who have worked and suffered for her,
she gathers together their memory, she thanks those who remember. To the friendships<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
and smiles that are offered her, she replies by a smile and a sincere and
faithful friendship.</p>

<p>To mention only the most recent events: In 1910, a statue of the great Washington
was offered to Versailles by the State of Virginia; in December, the Surrender
of Yorktown, by J. P. Laurens, was solemnly inaugurated in the Court
House of Baltimore. In 1911, commemorative monuments were erected at
Savannah, at Annapolis, at Mobile. Everywhere we find memorable proofs of
American sympathy. How could we do otherwise than respond?</p>

<p>And it is for this reason, these acts and so many similar ones having been noted
through the vigilance of the Ambassador of France at Washington, that the Committee
of France-America, encouraged by the French Government, took the initiative
of a subscription in order to bring to the lighthouse of Champlain a souvenir of
French gratitude. The subscription includes, in the first rank, the President of
the French Republic, Mr. Fallières; the President of the Council of Ministers,
Raymond Poincaré, the Ambassador of France at Washington, Mr. Jusserand,
the majority of the French ministers and a great number of our fellow-countrymen,
anxious to express their gratitude and their sympathy to the American Republic.</p>

<p>The delegation here present bears no official character, but Mr. Jusserand
accompanies it as the representative of the French Government and the Count de
Chambrun appears in it as the representative of the President of the Council. The
greatest French institutions also have their representatives therein; The Institut de
France, the Parliament, the French army, the State Council, the University, Industry,
Commerce, the Press; finally, the descendants of three of the families that have,
from the very beginning, shown their sympathy for the Franco-American cause.</p>

<p>Friendship—it is with this word that I wish to close, as it expresses the real
character of the sentiment that animates the Committee of France-America and
which its delegation has endeavored to convey in coming to you. We are friends
of the great American democracy; we come toward it with outstretched hands,
saying: Accept this friendship that is offered you and in return grant us yours.
We have nothing more to offer you than this image of that which we love best in
the world, France; and we ask nothing more of you than to understand how lively,
spontaneous and sincere this sentiment is.</p>

<p>Since the American democracy is at the head of the great human civilizations,
since it always marches forward, without, however, forgetting the bonds that bind
it to the past; since it has a noble heart, a generous soul, and since, according to
the word of the Latin writer, nothing human is foreign to it, we come to remind it
that these sentiments are also those that animate the French democracy; and, as
the two ideas are to-day united in the same monument, so may the two words be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
drawn closer together in the name of our Committee, France-America. We beg
of you not to allow the memory of this ceremony to be effaced from your hearts,
since the memory of Champlain is commemorated by you. We now confide to
you the image of our beautiful France. Watch over it as over an eternal pledge
of gratitude, of devotion, and of friendship. (Long applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>Commissioner Louis C. Lafontaine was then introduced and received
the gift in the following manner, speaking in the French language:</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p><em>Excellence, Messieurs de la Délégation Française, Mesdames, Messieurs</em>: C’est
un grand honneur pour moi, comme membre de la Commission du Troisième Centenaire
de la découverte du Lac Champlain, et au nom de mes collègues, de recevoir
le buste “La France” dont vous avez mission du peuple Français de venir déposer
au pied du Mémorial Champlain.</p>

<p>La Commission se plaît à voir dans ce beau geste de la mère-patrie de Champlain
le couronnement de ses efforts pour la glorification de l’un des plus illustres fils de
la France.</p>

<p>Votre mission est maintenant remplie, mais nous vous prions de vouloir bien en
accepter une autre, celle de transmettre à la nation française, les remerciements
les plus sincères et les plus cordiaux de la Commission Champlain pour l’honneur
qu’elle lui a fait en choisissant un si grand nombre parmi les plus illustres de ses
enfants pour leur conférer l’honneur de venir apposer ce cachet d’amitié au Mémorial
Porte-Lumière destiné à perpétuer le souvenir du Grand Champlain!</p>
</div>

<p>This concluded the formal exercises.</p>

<p>The visitors were then shown the ruins of Fort St. Frédéric and of
the English Forts, now included in the state reservation known as the
Crown Point Reservation, which are among the best preserved original
fortifications of the country.</p>

<p>The discoveries which are being made in and about the old French
Fort under the direction of Annie E. (Mrs. Walter C.) Witherbee,
are such as may lead to the rewriting of a description of these forts. She
has located the ovens and found the oven doors, candle-sticks, snuffers,
glassware, blue and white china of Fort St. Frédéric, built in 1731, the
underground drain, from the English Forts, built of stone two and one-half
feet high, resting on a solid rock and twenty inches in width in
perfect condition. She has also found the casemate and bastions around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the English Forts, which were built in 1759 by Amherst. She has
opened up the old forge and found many relics such as a gun-carriage,
chairs, knives, spades, iron bars, bolts and other articles. The most
remarkable discovery from a geological point of view was that of a
glacier mill 14 feet and 7 inches in depth, containing spherical stones,
unknown in the vicinity. Mrs. Witherbee has procured copies of old
charts and maps from British archives relating to the region. She is
also making a valuable historical collection of books, manuscripts and
autographs of persons, who have written about or have been occupants
of the forts now in ruins, but included in the State Reservation. These
will throw new light on the history of the region to the lasting credit of
Mrs. Witherbee, who intends to continue her researches in this hitherto
unexplored field.</p>

<p>At three-forty o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the Commissioners, accompanied by His
Excellency Ambassador Jusserand and the French delegation, boarded
the special train for Plattsburgh under the escort of Hon. John H.
Booth and Hon. John B. Riley. Upon their arrival at Plattsburgh, they
were officially welcomed by Mayor Andrew G. Senecal, the Guard
of Honor, and St. Jean Baptiste Society in full uniform. The depot
was trimmed with the American and French flags and the U. S.
Reservation at Plattsburgh Barracks had been put in readiness by Colonel
Cowles, Post Commandant, for the reception of the visitors to witness
a dress parade in their honor. As they entered the Reservation, a
national salute was fired and the regimental band played La Marseillaise
and the Star Spangled Banner. The Fifth Infantry in full dress
uniform was drawn up and saluted the distinguished visitors with military
honors. Colonel Cowles and his staff were formally presented by
Hon. H. Wallace Knapp to Ambassador Jusserand, M. Gabriel Hanotaux,
General Lebon, Count de Chambrun, M. Étienne Lamy and others.
The visitors were escorted to the temporary platform, whereupon the
Hon. V. F. Boire, speaking in French in behalf of the people of Plattsburgh,
welcomed the visitors. The English version of his address is
substantially as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Gentlemen</em>: It is a great pleasure as well as a special privilege to welcome you
to the city of Plattsburgh and the county of Clinton on this important occasion of
your peace errand. It is a pleasure to welcome you for many reasons. The personnel
of your delegation has so many illustrious and honored names; so many
of them dear to the hearts of the American people, that we welcome you individually
and personally, and we feel that you should be at home here. In the
average American heart, there is enshrined on either side of George Washington
the memory of Rochambeau and Lafayette, so no man bearing either name is a
stranger in the country of Washington, nor is he a stranger here, who is accredited
from their native land.</p>

<p>As representatives of the great French Republic, you are welcome to the nation
that the old France sustained and befriended in the hour of its almost hopeless
struggle for liberty. You are twice welcome in this particular spot; discovered
and explored by the great Champlain, trodden by the intrepid foot of Montcalm,
and sought out by the zealous heart of Jogues. It would be impossible to honor
us more than to permit us to see and hear representatives of so many branches of
French activities and learning, of men and institutions that have made for the
progress and enlightenment of the world; and in this particular locality, where
there are so many descendants of the French, this occasion affords an entirely distinct
and peculiar pleasure to the people.</p>

<p>Significant at this time and indirectly connected with your visit, and of interest
in connection with your visit, are the great peace projects now planned between
the United States and the British Empire. One is the Quebec-Miami International
Highway which is an assured fact, as a result of which a great International Highway
is actually being built, connecting the southern part of Florida with the city of
Quebec, and linking Canada and the United States with a strong bond of friendship
and good will. This road will pass through the city of Plattsburgh and its
length will be dotted with monuments dedicated to peace. And it is intended that
all travellers of this highway between Canada and the United States will pass
beneath an arch dedicated in the hope that no hostile foot will ever tread beneath.
This we believe to be a practical peace pact.</p>

<p>The monuments and arch just referred to are part of the second and most
widely known of the peace projects. By that I mean, the celebration of the one
hundredth anniversary of peace between the English speaking peoples (which also
seems to be an assured fact), to occur in 1914. By a singular coincidence, the
year 1914 will also mark the one hundredth anniversary of the last war between
French speaking and English speaking peoples. It would seem to me a most
lamentable thing if this celebration were not made a double celebration in commemoration
of the one hundred years of peace between the great French speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
peoples and English speaking peoples as well as between the English speaking
peoples. And let us hope that the year 1914 will also witness the adoption of all
the Arbitration Treaties under French speaking nations and English speaking
nations;—and thus we may hope that the year 1914 will not only be as a monument
to the century of peace in the past, but that it will also be a monument for
the peace of the centuries that are to come.</p>
</div>

<p>The visitors demonstrated their pleasure over his remarks by vigorous
applause. M. Étienne Lamy was then introduced and, speaking in
French, told of the pleasure of himself and his associates at the hearty
reception they had received at every place they had visited since coming to
America and said that at no place was the reception more cordial than at
Plattsburgh. General Lebon was the next speaker and his remarks were
also in French. He spoke of the great achievements of the French people
in all walks of life and especially in the military sphere. Count de Chambrun
spoke in English and told of the great friendship which has existed
between France and the United States ever since the first blow was
struck by the colonies for liberty; how the Republic of the East, through
him and his associates, sent greetings and promises of everlasting friendship
to the Republic of the West. M. Gabriel Hanotaux spoke briefly in
French and Ambassador Jusserand made a few remarks in both English
and French, expressing his pleasure in again visiting Plattsburgh. The
Saranac Chapter of the D. A. R. turned out in force with their regent.
Mrs. George F. Tuttle, and were accompanied by the Nathan Beman
Chapter of the Children of the American Revolution bearing the American
colors. The D. A. R. delegation was seated on the grandstand at
the left of the French visitors.</p>

<p>Mrs. George F. Tuttle, the regent of the Saranac Chapter, D. A. R.,
and president of the Nathan Beman Chapter, D. A. R., of Plattsburgh,
both of which organizations took part in the reception of the French
Delegation, expressed her pleasure and that of her Chapter at taking
part in welcoming the visitors, and also said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Saranac Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution and Nathan
Beman Society, Children of the American Revolution wish to extend greetings to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the French delegation who have so honored us by their presence. It may be of
interest to one of this distinguished company, the Count de Chambrun, to know
that among the Daughters who listened with delight to his remarks, was one whose
mother, Mrs. Frederick Sailly, had the pleasure of entertaining, as the wife of
Major Russell, at Fort Niagara, the Count’s honored ancestor, General Lafayette.</p>
</div>

<p>After regimental dress parade the visitors were returned to the depot
by automobile and left for Montreal on the regular 6 o’clock train, expressing
themselves enthusiastically in appreciation of the festivities arranged
in their honor in this country.</p>

<p>One of the French delegation, M. Gaston Deschamps, on May 3,
1912, reported to <cite>Le Temps</cite>, published in Paris, the exercises at Crown
Point and Plattsburgh, which is a graphic description of the impressions
made upon the visitors on that occasion. From that report we excerpt
the following, giving the English instead of the French original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>People have come from all the cities and towns about Port Henry; from all
the villages and hamlets near the Canadian frontier, to greet the French delegation.
A band of musicians advances and plays the “Marseillaise”—a Marseillaise
slow, sweet, as though languishing from the affectionate and cajoling
tenderness of our friends in the United States and New France. Our Marseillaise
lends itself admirably to that metamorphosis, and the warlike march of the Army
of the Rhine easily becomes, when one beats <i lang="it">adagio maestoso</i> time, a hymn of
solemn measure and touchingly religious.</p>

<p>Hon. Walter C. Witherbee, one of the most distinguished citizens of Port Henry,
is the President of the Inauguration Committee of the Champlain Monument at
Crown Point. For several years he has devoted the best part of his time and his
efforts to the work of the American and French commemorations of which we to-day
see the happy outcome. He has applied himself with all his heart to this intellectual
and moral enterprise, and he has brought to the service of his tenacious idealism
all the practical judgment of an excellent business man. I have learned—not
from him, for Mr. Witherbee is modesty itself—all that he has done for the
celebration of the third centenary of Champlain. Treasurer of the New York
Commission, he is the one especially who, with Senator Henry W. Hill and Mr. John
R. Myers, put through the necessary measures before the Government at Washington,
to the end that the commemorative festivities might be exceptionally brilliant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Clinton Scollard has sung the glory of Champlain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">A valiant son of that intrepid line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which gave fair lustre to the fame of France.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another poet, Mr. Percy MacKaye, has celebrated in his “Ballad of Ticonderoga”
the heroic defenders of Fort Carillon. Dr. Daniel L. Cady has dedicated
a whole bouquet of lyric verses to the picturesque beauties of Lake Champlain and
to the bravery of the good sailor of Saintonge:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Brouage sailor * * *</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">* * * Long live the Xaintongeois * * *</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It seems to me that at certain times “Young America” is in truth “Old
France.” This impression is strengthened still more after we have embarked on
the steamer which is to take us to the opposite shore of the lake, to the promontory
where the monument to the heroes of this magnificent fête is erected. This monument
is not yet finished. But the figure of the “Lord of Champlain, geographer
to the King, and captain of the Navy of the West,” is present in all minds because
on the pedestal of granite, under the gleam of the lighthouse, it is visible from top
to toe in the eyes of all sailors in quest of a good route in these parts. Here he
is, with his good face, a trifle broad, and very strong, his moustache curled up at
the ends, and his small pointed beard in the fashion of Louis XIII.; his lips, prompt
to reply, but skillful in keeping a secret; his large, thoughtful forehead, his eyes
full of dreaminess, and at the same time skilled in the exact knowledge of men
and things by the habit of his profession of watching the caprices of the inconstant
sea, of the changing heavens, and of the varying breezes. His lake, that “Sea of
the Iroquois,” whose Odysseyan distances he skimmed in birch-bark canoes paddled
by tattooed Hurons, with whom he felt at home—being, in the words of a narrator
of his voyages, “a man who was astonished at nothing, and a ready talker,
knowing how to accost these people tactfully and to accommodate himself to their
ways”—his lake we overlook to-day from the bulwarks of a steamer decorated
with all the splendor of holidays. His work is finished. What he foresaw, what
he predicted, what he prepared, has been realized. Civilization has laid hold upon
all these countries where he was the first explorer and of which he foretold in his
writings the future harvest. Here is the landscape whose picture he has described
so vividly that one can, after having read his “Voyages and Discoveries”, easily
find one’s way and recognize the different points; the immensity of this lake, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
fertile shores stretch in endless perspective; the hillsides covered with forests; the
islands “where there are plenty of walnuts and vines and pretty meadows.”
<span class="nowrap">* * *</span> In place of the encampments stockaded by the Iroquois or by the
Mohegans, filled with the noise of the tom-tom and the war dance, there are now
pleasant country houses where men and women of a less turbulent race can henceforth
enjoy a happiness which is no longer menaced by the unreasoned impulses
of a primitive and barbarous humanity.</p>

<p>As our steamer pulls out from the port and traverses the waves, gilded by the
sun, in the track which the achievements of Champlain have traced, we see the
buildings of Port Henry rise one above the other like an amphitheatre among the
forests in the woodland clearing. On the battlefield where the conqueror, peaceful
and brave, was forced to use his blunderbuss, there are now shipbuilders’ yards,
warehouses, factory chimneys. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> The horizon, under the vast dome of
the blue sky, is beautified by the whiteness of the snows, which shine with a silvery
splendor on the tops of the Adirondack Mountains and of those Green Mountains
which have given their ancient French name to the American State Vert Mont
(Vermont).</p>

<p>The weather is marvellous. This is the most beautiful day of our trip; a day
of brightness and of glory; what the Americans call a “glorious day.” A fine
breeze which comes from afar makes the gay colors of the oriflamme flutter from
the halyards of the ship. The French delegation is gay. We are happy to see
this admirable scenery, which was discovered by the eyes of a Frenchman. One of
our number is especially captivated by the beauty of this spectacle; it is the great
painter Cormon, appointed more than any one else, as one who could understand
and feel the charm of this vision, because his art is exercised and triumphs by turns
in the magnificent understanding of primitive times and in the fine meaning of the
beauties imagined by the modern æsthetic. We are happy to see that his ready
and true pencil has caught in passing some of the scenes from the fairyland before
us. Our notes on the trip will thus be much more accurate because of a true, exact
and sincere illustration, which would have been the delight of honest Champlain.</p>

<p>In honor of the heroes of this festival, and to please us, Mr. Witherbee’s musicians
play the airs which were most pleasing to the good mariners who came with Champlain
from Saintonge or from Aunis—the old songs of Old France. “<span lang="fr">C’est le roi
Dagobert</span>,” “<span lang="fr">J’ai du bon tabac dans ma tabatière</span>,” “<span lang="fr">La bonne aventure</span>, <span class="nowrap">ô gué.” * * *</span></p>

<p>Apropos of this, a Canadian whom I met at this delightful festival of French
remembrance told me that these songs, brought by Champlain’s sailors, preserved
by Montcalm’s sailors, still exist among “our people” all through the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Among us are still played on the hurdy-gurdy those refrains of long ago. We
transmit them in the family, from father to son, like a charming echo of the far away
mother country. If you come to our French villages in Canada, Monsieur,
to Beauharnais, to Saint Hilaire, to Maisonneuve, to Sorel, to Trois-Rivières, you
will hear all sorts of pleasant couplets which come in a direct line from Angoumois,
from Normandy, from Saintonge, from Poitou—and I, too, come from Poitou.</p>

<p>“So, then. Monsieur,” adds my Canadian questioner, laughingly, “We will
sing you some Poitevine songs, which will recall your childhood days and the quaint
melodies of the country-folk over there. We have a good collection of them. You
will only have the embarrassment of choice.”</p>

<p>And that good Frenchman of Canada begins to name over for me a whole
string of ancient sayings, which have retained the perfume and, as it were, the
melancholy softness of the gardens of the past. First of all a “danse ronde”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dans ma main droite y-a-t-un rosier</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui fleurira, manon lon la,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui fleurira au mois de mai.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entrez en danse, joli rosier!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et embrassez, manon lon la,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et embrassez qui vous plaira.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Indeed, I have heard that ingenious melody at home. To hear again, so far
from home, the words and the spirit of our old rural France, hard-working all the
week and always ready to dance and to “baller” during the Sunday leisure, is
an impression not to be forgotten and which at first seems like a dream.</p>

<p>“We also have,” my Canadian said to me, “the ‘Clear Fountain.’ Everybody
in Canada knows that romance, which came from Normandy. We also
have some ‘<span lang="fr">chansons de filasse</span>’ (flax songs) sung in tremulous voice by our good
grandmothers: ‘<span lang="fr">En filant ma quenouille</span>.’ Our Bretons have preserved their sea
songs: ‘<span lang="fr">A Saint-Malo, beau port de mer</span>.’ Or ‘<span lang="fr">Dans les prisons de Nantes</span>.’
And also:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fringue, fringue sur la rivière</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fringue, fringue sur l’aviron.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While thus, in that fine light, on the limpid water, under the tender blue of a
crystal sky, the heroic and charming soul of our ancestors was evoked, our ship,
surrounded by a whole fleet of decorated barks, draws near the pier at Crown
Point and stops in front of the monument of Champlain. This monument is a
lighthouse, of gray granite, sparkling with grains of mica which shine in the sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
like the facets of precious stones. The location of that edifice is well adapted to
the calling and the glory of him who was in these parts the guide of navigators.
In front of that lighthouse, on the prow of a symbolic vessel, there stands upright
the figure of the good pilot whose wake we have followed. <span class="nowrap">* * * While</span>
awaiting the completion of the statue, which has been begun, we have fastened to
the pedestal the image of France, modelled with infinitely delicate love by the strong
hand of the sculptor Rodin. That will be a token and, as it were, the sign of the
mother country on the monument which commemorates and consecrates a French
achievement.</p>

<p>At the moment when that image, veiled by the flags of France and of the United
States, is uncovered, appears to the gaze of the assembled crowd, the Marseillaise
vibrates in the resonant light. Our American friends and the Canadians present
applaud and cheer. We are deeply moved, we Frenchmen, before this figure, where
we recognize clearly the force and the sweetness of the mother country, the uprightness
of her thoughts, the loftiness of her sentiments, the nobility of her generous
desires. Never has an artist’s idea better expressed by the sovereign gift of art all
that there is of depth, of rarity, of the unique, in hearts animated by the imperative
desire to maintain the dominion of France; to enhance her glory. The head of the
French delegation, M. Gabriel Hanotaux, of the French Academy, former Minister
of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by the French Ambassador and the Governors
of the States of New York and of Vermont, delivers that precious pledge of remembrance
and of hope to the friendship of the American people. His eloquent words
are most appropriate to the occasion which reunites us, to the decorations which
astonish us, to the character of the great man whose admirable work gives us, at
the end of three centuries, the joy of seeing in this place the infinite results of a
French undertaking. The orator, in reviewing the life and work of Champlain,
points out how similar to Corneille was the soul of that contemporary of Richelieu,
and how this discoverer of new ways, this builder of towns, this initiator of civilization
into the New World, this idealist, prompt in the realization of his ideas, has
succeeded by the power of a thoughtful desire, preparing his projects far in advance
by prudent thought, wisely conceived, rapidly executed—having, in a word, as a
historian has said in the temperate and forceful language of long ago, “the intentions
of all he did.”</p>

<p>After M. Hanotaux, the Governors of New York and Vermont spoke. Their
excellent discourses, warmly applauded, reminded me again how well the history
of Champlain is known in America. In him they honor by turns the incarnation
of the genius of France; the honor and chivalry of France. To that explorer,
to that colonizer, they give that beautiful name of “honest man” which our ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
of the seventeenth century claimed more passionately than any other title:
navigator, explorer, honest man. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span></p>

<p>After that moving ceremony we were taken in automobiles to the ruins of Fort
Frédéric, which was constructed in 1731 by the Marquis de Beauharnois. The
whole population of Port Henry comes with us; they surround us, showing us every
courtesy.</p>

<p>In a group of children I see a pretty little boy with blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Doest thou know French”?</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is thy name”?</p>

<p>“Henri Pigeon.”</p>

<p>With a name so extremely French one does not need a certificate of origin. A
French priest, Father Guttin, professor in the College of Saint-Michel at Burlington,
on the other shore of Lake Champlain, told me that Henri Pigeon is one
of many children of a very honorable and hard-working Canadian family. The
father of that child works in the mines at Port Henry.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Plattsburgh</span>, Same Day, <em>May 3, 1912</em>, 5:30 o’clock.</p>

<p>The train, since leaving Port Henry, has traversed the left bank of Lake Champlain.
As we pass I notice shores of golden sand, hills thickly shaded by foliage,
pines, whose brilliant verdure glows on the azure of the blue water. Here is the
island of Valcour. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> What a pity not to be able to stop at all the stations
on that railroad, with its many villages with French names.</p>

<p>Plattsburgh is nearly the last American town before reaching the Canadian frontier.
It is full of remembrances of the War of Independence. The Federal Government
of the United States has established a strong garrison there. Here again
swift automobiles await us. The owner of one of these brilliant vehicles literally
carries me to the threshold of the station, at a lively pace, and on the way said to
me, in a calm, jolly voice:</p>

<p>“I am French, Monsieur; this is my son Raymond. We have only half an hour
to see our countrymen. And, well, we want to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>All this was said with a pleasing country accent. It is the accent we use in our
country. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> The auto stops at the entrance to a training field, where the
Fifth Regiment of Infantry of the Regular Army of the United States is ranged
in order of battle. The American Government wishes, at that last station in her
territory, to do us great honor, due, no doubt, to the presence as a member of our
delegation of General Lebon, former Commander-in-Chief of our First Army Corps.</p>

<p>The General takes his place on a platform in front of the public stand. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
regiment band plays the Marseillaise, which is followed by the solemn notes of the
American hymn, the Star Spangled Banner. The Mayor of Plattsburgh addresses
us in French, bidding us welcome. The procession starts immediately. A
very excellent showing of troops, by a young colonel (Calvin D. Cowles), who
manages a fiery horse most excellently, and who is surrounded by a body-guard of
officers dressed in uniforms heavily adorned with gold braid and shoulder pieces of
blue silk. A faultless procession; the sections well in line, the pace lively, the
carriage very military. When the starry flag passed, everybody stood up and
removed their hats. This scene is framed in a background of mountains and the
blue line of the lake, now lighted by the slanting rays of the setting sun. After the
military carriages had passed the colonel, accompanied by his staff, came and stood
before the stand, and with a sweeping gesture saluted us with his sword. The
American nation could not bid a more magnificent farewell to a delegation in which
figure the descendants of Rochambeau and Lafayette, and who belong to a nation
faithful to the traditions of a memorable fraternity in arms.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Saint Jean</span>, Same Day, <em>May 3, 1912</em>, 7 o’clock.</p>

<p>We have crossed the frontier. The evening falls over the Canadian fields. From
a clock exactly like those in the French parishes there comes the aerial call of the
Angelus. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> Instantly, in the station of Saint Jean there is heard a great
clamor. “<span lang="fr">Vive la France!</span>” Imagine an immense crowd, packed around the train,
preventing it from starting; waving three-colored banners; singing at the top of their
lungs the songs of this land and of the home land; the songs which, among us, are
sung to welcome parents and friends. Hands are extended; eyes seek other eyes.
One might call it the reunion of a family a long time separated. We are happy
to meet again. We detain each other. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> There are so many things to
say to each other. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> Everyone who has been present at this Canadian
welcome will treasure in the depths of his heart the remembrance of that moment
never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>This journey has been fertile in rapid and diverse impressions, carried away, alas!
too quickly by the flight of time. It was at times like artificial fire; too quickly
vanished. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> But this here—and I purposely make use of a familiar
phrase, which will be well understood by the French on both shores of the Atlantic—this,
is in truth the bouquet! (<span lang="fr"> Ceci, c’est véritablement le bouquet</span>).</p>

<h3 id="PartI_VII">VII. THEY VISIT CANADA, NIAGARA FALLS AND
SAIL FOR FRANCE. IMPRESSIONS AND COMMENTS
BY FRENCH VISITORS ON EXPERIENCES
IN AMERICA</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">Their reception by the Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce
and Citizens Association in Montreal was very hospitable.
A banquet was tendered the visiting delegation in the evening of
May 4th and on the following day a luncheon was given them by the
Franco-American Committee of Canada. Their reception at Quebec
on May 6th was also very cordial. They were greatly interested in the
city founded three centuries back by Samuel Champlain. They visited
its churches, its Parliament buildings, the Heights of Abraham, and
placed a wreath of flowers on the tomb of Montcalm. They were
pleased with the majestic sweep of the St. Lawrence, the Falls of Montmorency
and with the bracing air of Quebec, whose surrounding hills
were white with snow. Among the many who united in entertaining
them while in Canada were Senator Raoul Dandurand, President of
the Franco-American Committee of Canada, Sir Lomer Gouin, Premier
of the Province, M. Monk, Minister of Public Works, Lieutenant-Governor
Langelier, M. Montagu Allan, Vice-President of the Franco-American
Committee of Montreal, Mgr. Bégin of Laval University,
Messrs. R. W. Reford and Chaput, Presidents of the Canadian
Chambers of Commerce, M. Revol, President of the Montreal Chamber
of Commerce, M. Montpetit and M. de Crèvecœur, M. Ferdinand Roy,
President of the Canadian Institute at Quebec, and many others. The
mental exhilaration of the visitors increased as they moved about amid
the French speaking people of the Province, where the descendants of
French colonists with French customs dominated its language, its laws
and its institutions. On their return to France they spoke very appreciatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
of their visit to the Dominion of Canada, its hospitable people
and of its possibilities.</p>

<p>On their return from Canada via Niagara Falls, they were met there
by Senator Henry W. Hill, Secretary of the Commission, and were
entertained at luncheon by General Francis V. Greene, who in faultless
Parisian French paid a glowing tribute to their countrymen. He
escorted them about the Falls and showed them the power plants on the
Canadian shore and took them in a special car around the Gorge Route.
They were deeply interested in the Falls, the Whirlpool and power
houses. They took the evening train for New York, where they embarked
on <i>La Provence</i>, May 9th, for France.</p>

<p>Commissioners Howland Pell and Senator James A. Foley and
Viscount de Jean of the French Embassy at Washington, Senator
Raoul Dandurand of Montreal and others were on the dock to bid them
“farewell” and “bon voyage.” Each gentleman of the delegation was
presented with a photograph of the Waldorf-Astoria banquet and each
lady with a bouquet of La France roses.</p>

<p>All the delegates were charmed with the cordiality of their reception,
both in the United States and Canada, and most of them expressed their
intention of coming again.</p>

<p>M. Gabriel Hanotaux, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and president
of the delegation, in a conversation before <i>La Provence</i> left the
quay, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe that the time has come for closer relations to be developed between
France and America from many points of view. There is one point beyond doubt.
We have seen recently that when France withdraws her financial support from any
international project the carrying out of the project is at any rate delayed. France
is a rich country, and has money to invest, but she must first see that her interests
are safeguarded. In America the thing that struck me and most of the delegation
was the prodigious activity everywhere. Everything in the country gives evidence
of unique strength which must play a great rôle in the world. I am really charmed
with my first visit to the United States and Canada and hope to have an opportunity
of coming again. We in France are convinced that trade can be improved
to a great extent. The present statistics do not, however, give France her proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
place, as a great deal of the French trade passes across the Atlantic on British,
Belgian and German vessels and is credited to the first port of debarkation, although
many of the American exports eventually go to France.</p>
</div>

<p>M. Gabriel Hanotaux, in referring to French literature, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The greatest error appears to exist in American and British minds on the subject
of French literature. I myself know that the French love a pure literature and I
am certain that that kind of writing is the only kind that is profitable in France
itself. All the modern French writers, too, are of the same opinion. The indelicate
French books appear to be written only for the foreigner, for they have no vogue
whatever in France.</p>
</div>

<p>On a prior occasion M. Gabriel Hanotaux expressed the pleasure of
the delegation at the reception given it in this country, saying that from
the moment they had placed foot upon this soil they have been captivated
and carried away in a whirlwind of cordiality and good-fellowship.
About the reception by President Taft the French statesman said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The President, despite his overwhelming occupations, received us at his table;
in the very kindest manner he honored, in our persons, the thought which has brought
us here. He was so kind as to give us personally, in connection with our visit,
assurances of his encouragement and approval; which have been for us an ample
reward. These countless acts of friendship of all kinds we have looked upon—and
rightly so—as being addressed to our beloved mother country and to the
Government of the French Republic which has so splendidly encouraged and aided
us in the accomplishment of our mission.</p>
</div>

<p>On its return from America, the French delegation which had attended
the Champlain exercises, was entertained in Paris at a grand
dinner, on June 17, 1912. It was a truly brilliant assemblage, presided
over by M. Raymond Poincaré, President of the Council, and Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Prominent among the large number at the tables
were the sculptor, Rodin; Paul Hervieu, of the French Academy;
Louis Barthou, deputy and former Minister; General Brugère, former
vice-president of the Conseil Supérieur of War, and president of the
United States section of the Franco-American Committee; and many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
others eminent in the official, military, naval, financial, literary and art
circles of France. The aviator, Blériot, was a guest, representative of a
putative new science. Many ladies also graced the occasion.</p>

<p>Among the Americans in attendance was the American Ambassador,
the Hon. Myron Herrick, to whom the presiding officer, M. Poincaré,
in his opening remarks, most happily referred as having come “to testify
that his country, less near to us by parentage than is Canada, is still just
as near at heart.” American hospitality, he said, which surprises and
charms the French, whenever they cross the ocean, is but an expression
of a constant memory. “As Monsignor Ireland so well says: ‘The
United States forget nothing. In learning the history of his own country,
an American learns to love France. The Past has not ceased to be felt
in the Present. American sentiment is unable to detach itself from
France. Emigrants, it is true, arrive in vast numbers on our soil; but
there is a something, I know not what, in the air we breathe, that assimilates
them in less than a generation. And the new-comers become like
the earlier ones.’”</p>

<p>M. Gabriel Hanotaux, of the French Academy, President of the
Franco-American Committee, reviewed the experiences of the French
delegation in their journey to Lake Champlain, and in his very felicitous
remarks, “addressed, across the seas, a salutation of thanks and of
gratitude, on the part of France to the United States of America and to
the Dominion of Canada, in response to the welcome extended by these
two countries, last month, to the French delegation visiting Lake Champlain.”
He drew a lively picture of incidents of the journey, especially
of the arrival at Ticonderoga:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is impossible to express the emotion which we felt when we saw
that there was the goal of our journey; that our feet would tread in the
footsteps of our great compatriots of by-gone ages; that this little bay
was where Champlain embarked, in the Indian canoes, to go to discover,
southwards, the land where sprang up Boston and New York; that here
were those famous passes, defended, later on, foot by foot by the French
heroes of the 17th and 18th centuries; that these ruins are of Fort Carillon;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that these fields, these hills and woods, were the battle ground where
Montcalm had fought and conquered; and that here, in a word, was the
lake toward which we had fared all these weeks, and where we came
to enshrine, at the foot of the commemorative monument, the image
which we had brought, with precious care—from the land of France,
on the ship <i>La France</i>, the image of France!”</p>
</div>

<p>The speaker paid graceful tribute to the genius of Rodin; dwelt upon
the welcome which the delegation had met with in Canada; thanked all
who had contributed to the pleasure and success of the mission, and concluded
by proposing the health of the President of the United States,
His Majesty George the Fifth, the people of all Latin America, of the
delegation’s hosts in the United States and Canada, and of the Franco-American
Committee.</p>

<p>He was followed by Senator Dandurand, President of the Franco-American
Committee of Montreal, who spoke of Canadian development,
and of the relations of Canada and the United States. At the close of
his address he was invested with the insignia of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>Then followed the address of the Deputy, Louis Barthou, which
sparkled with wit and happy hits. The speaker paid particular tribute
to M. Hanotaux; dwelt upon the enthusiasm with which their delegation
had been met, and made repeated acknowledgment of the courtesies they
had received. His Excellency, M. Puga-Borne, Minister from Chili,
spoke briefly, and was followed by the American Ambassador, Mr.
Herrick, who happily acknowledged the compliments and courtesies
bestowed upon him and his country, and closed by proposing the health
of the President of the French Republic. The exercises were concluded
by a brief address from the presiding officer, M. Raymond
Poincaré, who referred to the part which the Franco-American Committee
had borne in the carrying out of the Champlain commemorative
project.</p>

<p>On May 25, 1912, the newly-appointed Ambassador from the United
States to France, Mr. Myron T. Herrick, and Mrs. Herrick, gave a
reception at the American Embassy to the French delegation which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
represented France in the Champlain ceremonies. Some seventy guests
were present, and were welcomed by the Ambassador in a felicitous
speech, to which M. Hanotaux replied most happily in behalf of the
delegation. M. Antonin Dubost also spoke on the unbroken amity so
long existing between France and the United States.</p>

<p>The <cite>Courrier des États-Unis</cite> of November 10, 1912, published an
address delivered at the annual meeting of the Five Academies by M.
Paul Vidal de la Blache, delegate of the Academy of Moral and
Political Science. On the occasion referred to, M. Frédéric Masson, of
the French Academy, presided. M. de la Blache said in opening his
address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Gentlemen</em>: In the course of a journey which a French delegation
made last spring, to pay homage to the memory of Samuel Champlain,
there was one day interesting above all others. I am sure none of our
company will lose the memory of it. Many have eloquently expressed
the impression which they cherish. Impressions of travel are usually
fleeting; they become dim by their very multiplicity, and the daily train
of events soon relegates them to the limbo of the forgotten. However,
the memory of this day has not ceased after several months to spring
freshly to mind. Such is the quality of countries which are stamped by
the seal of history. To know the regions upon which the eyes of Champlain
rested, to press under foot the fragments of palisades upon which
was spilled the blood of the soldiers of Montcalm, is assuredly a moving
experience.”</p>
</div>

<p>The speaker found that a visit to places thus endowed with associations,
was like reviewing history condensed. He sketched the course of
history in the Champlain valley, recalled the scenes of strife between
Iroquois and Huron, English and French, English and “Americans of
the Union.” “These memories,” he said, “crowded upon our thought
and took form as we visited the scene which served to frame them.” The
speaker lightly reviewed the varied scene as presented to the French
visitors passing northward from New York to Ticonderoga. When he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
found himself on the battlefield of July 8, 1758, he exclaimed: “How
fiction pales before history!” The memories of Montcalm and his army
are so vivid that he sees again the memorable conflict of the old days.
“This corner of historic earth,” he said, “by turn the property of the
State of New York and of Columbia University, in 1818 passed into
the hands of an old New York family. The descendants of Mr. William
F. Pell honor themselves in preserving the souvenirs of the past, which
they have in keeping.” He described the work of restoration which has
been done at Ticonderoga, and dwelt with pleasure on the reception
accorded the visitors at the old house with its souvenirs, its old furniture,
pictures and relics, and with its distinctive portico, or veranda, which
M. de la Blache found an interesting feature of Anglo-American Colonial
architecture, from New England to Virginia.</p>

<p>Crossing to Crown Point, he reviewed in like strain the scenes and
the associations of the place. At Crown Point, the speaker was overwhelmed
by the memory that here, in 1609, came Champlain with his
Algonquin allies. In a few picturesque sentences, he sketched the first
conflict in this region, of white man against Iroquois, not forgetting to
emphasize the higher mission which Champlain sought to accomplish.</p>

<p>Of the exercises which were held at this point, where M. Hanotaux
delivered a notable address, M. de la Blache spoke at length. It was,
he said, a ceremony very beautiful in its simplicity. “Around us
familiarly crowded the people of the neighborhood, worthy farmers
with something of a Puritan aspect, an attentive throng in which mingled
many French Canadians; for we had come near to the actual boundary
line of the languages.” “While the orator recalled the expressions by
which Champlain described the country which revealed itself to us, our
attention sought and found the distinctive features in the setting of this
scene. Opposite, on the western shore, reared the massive granite of the
Adirondacks, wooded, and partly covered with snow, the silhouette of
which recalled, in grander proportion, that of the mountains of Morvan,
seen from the south. On the other side, the more distant outline of the
Green mountains, bathed in the luminous calm of a spring-time day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>In similar vein, the speaker described his progress down the lake to
Plattsburgh, where he recalled the associations of 1814. Thence on to
the first Canadian town of St. John: “The fading day permitted us
only to dimly see in the shadows of evening the Grand Isle, Isle La
Motte, Isle aux Noix, which Champlain describes as ‘These beautiful
islands filled with the finest woods and prairies,’” etc. The speaker
passed on in his address to recall his visit to Montreal and Quebec, with
tributes to the heroes of France who have made this region famous.
“There remains to-day in our minds,” he says, “a sentiment of high
regard for those who inspired in 1909 the commemoration of the tercentenary
of Champlain’s discovery. Resulting from the initiative of
the states of New York and Vermont, and endorsed by Federal authority
and later honored by the participation of France, this celebration
has taken a more general character than the mere glorification of a great
man. It signifies the adoption by America of all the heroes who have
contributed to our greatness. This homage was not confined to Champlain;
it is shared with Montcalm, it is addressed to La Salle, to Marquette,
whose statue appears in the Capitol at Washington; to Maisonneuve,
the founder of Montreal, to whom is reared a statue upon one of
the city places; to La Clède, whose statue is reared in one of the parks
of St. Louis; to Joliet, to d’Iberville, to Hennepin and Duluth, and to
many others who, on Lake Champlain, on the Ohio, on the Great Lakes,
or on the Mississippi, were the pioneers of a dominion, which should come
to be realized some day, but far after them and otherwise than they
would have conceived. Doubtless America honors herself in honoring
and adopting our glories. With this act of courtesy mingles a strong
sentiment of pride. It costs us nothing, however, to associate ourselves
with an homage which concerns us, and from which we can draw a
sense of consolation.</p>

<p>“The names which I have recalled are more popular in America than
in their own country. We show ourselves forgetful of their fame, as if
to make their memories bear the blame of our failings. A somewhat
pusillanimous feeling makes us neglect this part of our historic inheritance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
as one turns aside from painful memories, the bitterness of which he fears.
These regrets assuredly are justified. ‘<i lang="la">Sic vos non vobis</i>’: such is the
phrase which springs to the lips. I do not believe, however, that such
should be the last word, nor the final sentiment at which we ought to
stop. In an address delivered three years ago, July 4, 1909, on the
occasion of the Champlain Tercentenary fêtes, Cardinal Gibbons said:
‘We are much indebted to France for the great men whom she has sent
to our country.’ Must one see in these words only a passing compliment?
Rather do I perceive therein the emphasis of history. These Frenchmen,
above all others, had prophetic vision of the extent and dimensions which
this continent could afford to political domination. They perceived with
larger vision than the tenacious colonists who applied their Puritan virtue
and their practical sense to inlaying their settlements, one by one, between
the sea and the Appalachians. These were the founders; but we may
ask whether, without the perspectives opened by our countrymen, without
their example and the emulation which it stimulated, this powerful
unity, of which our epoch has seen the accomplishment from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, would be
realized. There is a something in the views, the plans, of this generalizing
spirit, characteristic of our compatriots. Thinking of France, they have
outlived the grandeur of the United States. Since by commemorations
and by monuments, America honors herself by reminding us that in her
eyes, as happy inheritor, a part of her present grandeur is the work of
Frenchmen of other days, it becomes us to take her at her word. In the
work of civilization, as it evolves, each bit of metal which the old nations
throw into the crucible adds a quality and communicates its own resonance
to the ingot which comes out. Doubtless it is to recover this past, which
arouses hope within us—something besides the memory of deceit, the
sense of having lost what the heroic contemporaries of Richelieu and
Colbert caught sight of, for their country. Our American work is not
to be summed up as a failure. It is the Americans themselves who
recognize this and who say it.”</p>

<h3 id="PartI_VIII">VIII. IMPRESSIONS OF M. RENÉ BAZIN</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">In the <cite>Revue des Deux Mondes</cite> for September, 1912, is published a
pleasant article by M. René Bazin, of the French Academy, entitled
“Paysages d’Amérique,” in which he gives a graphic and poetic
account of his American visit as a member of the French delegation, which
presented the statue of France for the Champlain memorial. He tells
of the voyage, paints vividly his first impressions of New York, chats of
his visit to Washington, with many fresh impressions of scenes and people.
His article, which is in journal form, brings him to Lake Champlain,
May 3, 1912. After noting various incidents of the journey north,
he continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since last evening we have traveled by special train to the banks of Lake Champlain.
Early this morning, the sensation of being still awoke me. I opened the
window of the Pullman and saw that we were stopped on a siding, in the open
country. Day was breaking; the sun had not yet risen. Before me, at the right
of the railroad, were low lands, grassy, wild, like neglected pastures. Further on,
a great house under the elms, and further yet the waters of the lake, the gleam of
which came to me in rays between the white mists which rolled up. The silence was
perfect. It was the season, already past with us, when the blackbirds at day-break
poise themselves on the top of the trees.</p>

<p>Nothing was lacking. The outlines of the hills beyond the lake and above the
mists, were of a vivid blue, and, suddenly, the globe of the sun showed itself.
Presently a great heron, seeking the woods, came on wing, his legs like a rudder,
and crossed over the bank. I hear the sound of the beats of his short wings; I hear
the coming of a train on the distant horizon, and the noise is so sharp that it makes
me realize the immensity of the land through which it spreads. Primitive peace is
still here. I go out; I notice at the left of the line the successive level of wooded
hills, the highest of which have the appearance of mountains. These are the Adirondacks.
They call them “Green Mountains” in the country. But they look out
upon the morning and the myriads of buds massed together clothe them in purple.
Oaks, perhaps; probably maples; this beautiful maple which has two red seasons.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock automobiles come for us. I get into the first, with Hanotaux
and two others of our companions. We have not a long road to go. On one side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
clear woodland; a short approach, a turning to the left, a fine descending curve
planted with green trees, and we are before the steps of a great villa on the shores
of the lake. Our hosts for the morning, Mr. and Mrs. S. H. P. Pell, came to us on
the veranda. The automobiles stop and at once a little boom of cannon is heard
ahead of us. We look in the direction whence the shot comes and we see the grass
of the field all starred with tricolor flags. A second automobile arrives. It is
saluted as were ourselves. In the fine house,—very well lighted, very white, ornamented
with family portraits and with old engravings representing scenes of other
days in this place so enriched in history, we are greeted with a graciousness and a
knowledge of the world which is manifested through a considerate and sincere heart.
There are some moments in which plain people and simple actions become arguments
in favor of a country. I shall never again hear the American spirit ill-spoken
of without recalling the hospitality of the Americans of Ticonderoga. The
name is an Indian name of the fortress which was entrusted by Louis XV. to the
Marquis de Montcalm. The French have said, say, and will say, “<span lang="fr">Carillon</span>.”
At Carillon, July 8, 1758, the Marquis de Montcalm had only 3,570 regulars, 87
marines, 85 Canadians, and 16 Indians, under his command,—that is to say, 3,758
soldiers. But he was entrenched in the woods and he had a refuge in case of need.
Abercromby commanded an army of 16,500 men and he came on to conquer this
feeble enemy and to establish finally English dominion over Canada. The hour
was not yet come. Once more, although the enemy was brave and determined,
France with unequal arms was victorious.</p>

<p>Entering Mr. Pell’s house, we were reminded of this date, these figures, and of
their fine significance. We remembered that in this forest where we are, Montcalm in
early morning, throwing off his jacket and crouching under the branches of a tree,
said to his men who labored to gather the stones for the intrenchments, “Children,
the day will be hot!” We recall that at evening in the same place, as the fading
light of day was prolonged by the reflection of the lake, he wrote: “What a day
for France! The little army of the King conquers his enemies. Ah, what troops like
ours! I have never seen their equal!”</p>

<p>In how many parts of the world, among others, cannot memory speak to us
thus softly of the glory of our arms! But what is delicious here is that a foreign
family which entertains us, also remembers, and that it understands, and that it
recognizes something beyond the mere history.</p>

<p>While they served us with a well-ordered breakfast—there were even fruits
from California and Florida in aromatic wine—our hosts and the parents of our
hosts spoke to us of that France that they know and love, of Cartier, of Roberval,
of Champlain, “father of the aborigines,” of the missionaries, of Frontenac, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Vaudreuil and of Montcalm. These names lived again and those of their
adversaries.</p>

<p>We learned that Mr. Pell has sought to buy all the lands around Ticonderoga
where the French and English fought, so that no one shall build a hotel there and
lessen the sacred character of this landscape. Is it not a fine stroke, and does he
belong by chance to this “material civilization,” of which they have made in respect
to Americans so much reproach, so much hard compliment? We go out of the
house; we cross the field, and, the ground falling away a little, we are in front of a
square fortress of stone, protected by ditches. The proprietors have restored it,
but the great part of these old stones are truly stones of war, and the black rafters
of the chambers have become brown by the smoke of pipes which were lighted in
the hard winter of this climate by the lost and almost abandoned children of the
regiments of France.</p>

<p>One thinks of the reproaches which they would have made to the news brought
by the Indians, to the wind which howled, to the snow storm.... The fort is decorated
in our honor. On its front, a bronze plaque bears this inscription: “Germain
redoubt constructed by captain Germain, <span lang="fr">régiment des Gardes de la Reine</span>, in 1758,
by order of the marquis de Montcalm, in command of <ins class="corr" id="tn-103" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the forteress of'">
the fortress of</ins> Carillon.”</p>

<p>The extent of the old covered way, cut through to-day, brings us to the interior
of the earthworks. Before us, at 500 meters, high glacis crown the hill and conceal
just at the roof line a construction which would have served as quarters for the
officers. I notice two flags waving at the end of two great flagstaffs, and more
below, like a basket of violets moving, for the wind is brisk, where they have been
planted. But no one explains to me yet what we have come to see, and Mr. Pell,
who walks with me, stooping, picks a woolly leaf of a wild plant, and says to me:
“Keep it as souvenir. Right here, some years ago, we set out to make an excavation.
At the first stroke of the pick the workmen uncovered some bodies clothed
in trimmed uniforms. They were immediately ordered to cover them up and not
to disturb them.” We were moved. I continued to ascend the hill. One has to
turn a little to find the entrance into the fortress of Carillon. A dozen cannon
outside are still pointed towards the lake and towards the little neighboring mountain,
“The mount of France” which drew the English artillery. I enter the enclosure
of the fortress. It is trimmed up. It awaits France. Ah, see who has come—<i>La
France!</i> and she sees in front of the wall of Montcalm’s old quarters, ten
silken standards which the wind lifts and lets fall heavily on the staffs; violet
squares bordered with white, blue panels barred with red, many-colored banners, all
the standards of the regiments of France which were represented at the battle of
Carillon. The victorious colors live again in the light, and a little above, dominating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the broken walls and the roofs, two great flags protect the others, command
them and explain them; the starry flag of young America and the banner of
ancient France, all white and strewn with Fleur-de-lis. My eyes fill with tears,
and I really think that two tears have fallen. I am sure that they said, “Long
live this American who has a deep heart.” They say still other things and I
feel myself living wholly in the France of other days.</p>

<p>The house of the fort has become a museum; swords, guns, ammunition, letters,
keys, spades which were broken in throwing up the entrenchments, engravings of
several periods, are there hung on the walls or arranged in showcases; even an old
watch, which the journal of the fortress, likewise preserved, states, had been lost
among the ruins. We linger there and I notice that our traveling companions speak
less as time passes. But when we have made the round of the walls of Carillon
and when we notice in the full light of ten o’clock in the morning all the country
which the old fort commands, words come again; joy, also; the ground descends
from there down to the lake, narrow at this point; the hills rise gradually and the
blue of the distance defines itself in clear lines upon the pale azure of the horizon.
Some one says: “Do you not notice how that resembles the plain of Pau, as seen
from the terrace?” Indeed, if I efface from my memory the image of blue waters,
which the waters of Lake Champlain disturbed by the melting snows do not at all
resemble, and which do not reflect the sky, the two landscapes have a similarity.
Even the atmosphere is transparent here, revealing the elevated conformation of the
distance. Another of our companions, who soon notices the extended form of the
lake and the color of the trees on the lower level, says, almost at the same moment,
“I believe I see the Vosges with Retournemer and Longemer.” In other ways we
recognize here French harmonies.</p>

<p>Some hours later, we are on a point of land quite far from the fort of Carillon,
at the foot of a white stone lighthouse. The light overlooks a stretch of bad rock
land, standing in the midst of low places and fields which stretch out behind it.
What a desert this would be, and from the origin of the world, this spur on which
break the short waves of Lake Champlain!</p>

<p>But to-day the people of the American towns, those who live in the Adirondacks,
those from the other side of the water, miners, farmers, and various workers, or
trout fishers, who have come to prepare for the coming season, have assembled at
Crown Point Forts. Some horses, picketed, browse in the fields; others are hitched to
the branches of a hawthorne—the remains, perhaps of an old plantation, set out
by the hand of a jealous old French soldier. Some American carriages, a little seat
on four very light wheels; some wagons, twenty automobiles, are scattered on the
grass, while around the lighthouse, on all the levels of the rock, are seated upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
benches or on the ground a mixed population, intimate, badly controlling the children
who race around like young quail; listening, understanding—or pretending to
understand—the speeches which glorify Champlain. The bronze medallion which
represents France, the work of Rodin, brought by us, is already set in its niche in
front. The wind blows; it causes to vibrate the ten cords stretched from the
lantern of the lighthouse to the ground in a crown, and flaps the big canopy and
all the flags which ornament it. And as my mind wanders when the speeches are
in English, I listen to what the flags are saying:</p>

<p>“Do you see them, these people seated in the front row? They don’t belong
here.”</p>

<p>“It’s plain that they don’t belong here. You’re not saying much of anything:
Are they tanned by the open air? Have they the free and easy way of the
American citizen?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that they are from Paris?”</p>

<p>“You have a very simple way of being sure of it, my dear. Did you ever
hear such a noise! Listen! When they are from Paris, there is never any lack
of talk!”</p>

<p>“—Precisely, the orator proclaims himself; he comes from Paris.”</p>

<p>“Not of great extent, this France?”</p>

<p>“Not very formidable?”</p>

<p>One flag, smoke-blackened, said:</p>

<p>“Not very serious?”</p>

<p>Then, the English flag, which had said nothing, snapped a blow so sharp that
a whip wouldn’t have been better.</p>

<p>“Very serious, my dear. I’ve known the French. I’ve known the French at a
time when you were not such a much, be it said without offense to you. I have
known Champlain. He had a jovial way. He was usually pleasant. The
Indians said of him: ‘We like to hear you speak. You always have something
pleasant to say.’ But, believe me, I understood him: it was as a colonial and a
rough adversary, I say adversary, because that is the name that one gives to his
old enemies when they have become his friends, you understand?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well.”</p>

<p>I leave the flags, ruffling. I think of this brave man, whose fête this is, at this
moment, in his little sleepy and grass-grown town of Brouage: of the dreams of
glory that were his, all youthful, like those of a good many men of his time, and
which he accomplished because he had a heart capable of suffering for his love.
For he loved France. He left her, the better to serve her. He bore with him, to
the West Indies, and afterwards to Canada, a poor companion, a perfect and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
holy image. Almost alone among the savages, having carried upon his strong
shoulders, oars, provisions and the blanket for his bed at night, enured to heat, to
cold, to mosquitoes, to long exiles and the perpetual treason of men, over these
identical grounds where we now are, he made his way to discovery, beholding a
new world reveal itself about him, and giving it to his Lord in heaven, as he gave
it to his King, secretly, hourly, by each glance with which he took possession of
this unknown world. For he says: “Kings should not think of extending their domination
in infidel lands, except to establish there the reign of Christ.” Commerce
was not forgotten. But what superior humanity! It is still living, only disregarded.
Champlain has passed here. I realize that this landscape has been reflected in his
eyes as it is in mine. This landscape? Is it indeed sure? Where are the trusty
witnesses? Not the meadow, which is new. Not the trees, too young for him to
have known, nor the waters, which have changed, nor the clouds, nor even the
ancestors of the spectators assembled on this strand. We can scarcely say that the
movement of the sun sang as to-day, the same verse in the hymn universal.</p>
</div>

<p>M. Bazin concludes with a running account of his continued journey
to Montreal and Quebec, recalling at length their wealth of historic
associations.</p>

<h3 id="PartI_IX">IX. COMMENT IN APPRECIATION OF THE VISIT OF
THE FRENCH DELEGATION AND HONORS CONFERRED</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The mission of the French delegation proved to be of far deeper
import, than the mere presentation of the Rodin bust, gratifying to
Americans as was that superb gift on the part of its donors. It
awakened in the people of this country, quite as much as it did in the members
of that delegation, renewed interest in the activities and achievements
of the peoples of the two Republics, which are the foremost democracies
of the world. M. Hanotaux, a scholar, a statesman and a diplomat
and his distinguished colleagues, are among the foremost citizens of
France. They represented the several departments of the Government
as well as the various trades and professions in the civil life of that
Republic. Commerce and industries were represented by M. Antoine
Girard, Counsellor of Foreign Commerce. Their reputation had long
been established in science, in literature and in the fine arts and also in
jurisprudence, in statesmanship and in diplomacy, as exemplified in the
genial and charming personality of Ambassador Jusserand. They are
among the present day celebrities of the French nation and were invited
to become members of the Embassy on account of their individual
standing in the official, social and intellectual life of that Republic.</p>

<p>One cannot read their addresses and their reports to Paris of the
impressions, which they formed on their visit to America, without
appreciating the spontaneity of their tributes to the American people and
to their institutions, the warmth of their expressions of good will and
generous impulses towards the people of this nation and their gratitude
for the deep interest shown by the people of the United States, and
especially by those of Vermont and New York, in commemorating the
achievements and the character of one of their countrymen.</p>

<p>The unreported addresses of Baron D’Estournelle de Constant,
member of the French Senate and the representative of France at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Hague International Peace Tribunal, and of M. Louis Barthou,
ex-Minister of Justice and one of the leading Parliamentarians of the
Chamber of Deputies, will long be remembered for their urbanity, for
the breadth of their views, and for the brilliancy of their eloquent periods.
The addresses of M. Hanotaux and others and the foregoing reports of
Gaston Deschamps, of M. de la Blache, the geographer of the University
of Paris, and of René Bazin, of the French Academy, disclose the character
and beauty of the style of the French littérateurs. Wherever the
members of the delegation went, they were gratefully welcomed and
entertained in stately manner. The social functions taxed the powers
of endurance on the part of the visitors to their full extent. They made
hosts of friends and gave Americans opportunity to meet them and to
become acquainted with gentlemen and ladies possessed of the rare
culture and refinement of French life. Their visit was timely and did
much to strengthen the ties that bind the peoples of the two Republics
in friendly accord. They made an impression on the people of this
country that will be quite as enduring as the bronze testimonial of the
good will of the people of France towards those of the United States,
firmly set in the granite base of the Champlain Memorial at Crown
Point Forts and there was voiced by the friends, whom they made in
America, the sentiment, <i lang="fr">Vive la France</i>.</p>

<p>Some months after the return of the French delegation to France,
Commissioner Walter C. Witherbee was appointed by the President of
the French Republic a Knight of the Legion of Honor, which was
formally and appreciatively acknowledged by this Commission.</p>

<p>Knighthood in the Legion of Honor was also conferred by the President
of France upon Hon. Frank S. Witherbee, a member of Preliminary
Champlain Commission and President of the Lake Champlain
Association, which participated in the entertainment of the French delegation
at the Waldorf-Astoria banquet on May 1, 1912.</p>

<p>Hon. A. Barton Hepburn, President of the Chamber of Commerce
of the State of New York, which entertained the French delegation at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
luncheon on May 2, 1912, has recently been decorated by the President
of France with the honorary rank of Officer in the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>The French Government has recently presented to Honorable
Charles B. Alexander, member of the Society of the Cincinnati, who gave
a reception on April 30, 1912, to the French delegation in his beautiful
home at No. 4 West 58th Street, New York City, the artistic Sèvres
bisque group of national manufacture, known as “Télémaque chez
Calypso,” by the sculptor, M. Louis Simon Boizot.</p>

<p>Knighthood in the Legion of Honor was also conferred by the President
of the Republic of France upon President John H. Finley of the
College of the City of New York, who has taken deep interest in the
life of Samuel Champlain and in French colonization in America. His
felicitous remarks at the Waldorf-Astoria banquet on May 1, 1912, were
genuinely appreciated by Ambassador Jusserand, the members of the
French delegation, and all others in attendance. President Finley was
the Harvard Exchange lecturer under the Hyde Foundation in 1910 at
the University of Paris and at ten other French universities.</p>

<p>In February, 1913, His Excellency, Raymond Poincaré, President of
the Republic of France, appointed Henry W. Hill, Secretary of the
New York Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commission, a Knight of
the Legion of Honor, in recognition of his public, literary and other
services in connection with the Tercentenary Celebration from its inception
in 1907 to the conclusion of the Final Report of the Commission
in 1913.</p>

<p>These delicate and touching expressions of appreciation on the part of
President Fallières, President Poincaré, Ambassador Jusserand and the
citizens of France of the courtesies shown to the members of the French
delegation, while in the United States, are still further evidences of the
warmth of the kindly feelings existing between the people of that Republic
and those of this nation, and are gratefully appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="PartII_I">I. PREPARATION FOR DEDICATORY CEREMONIES,
INCLUDING MILITARY FEATURES</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The Commission decided to have the dedicatory ceremonies of the
Crown Point memorial on July 5, 1912, and of the Plattsburgh
memorial on July 6, 1912, the anniversary week of the Tercentenary
Celebration. Formal invitations to the dedicatory ceremonies of
the Crown Point memorial were sent by the New York and Vermont
Lake Champlain Commissions, and to the dedicatory exercises of the
Plattsburgh memorial, by the New York Commission, to the President
and Vice-President of the United States, to the United States Senators
of New York and Vermont, to the members of Congress from the Champlain
valley, to the French Ambassador, His Excellency, J. J. Jusserand,
the British Ambassador, the Right Honorable James Bryce and
to Count and Countess de Peretti de la Rocca and to M. Maugras,
members of the French Embassy and to members of the British Embassy
at Washington, to the Governors, Lieutenant-Governors and other
officials of New York and Vermont, including Hon. William Sohmer,
State Comptroller, Hon. Andrew S. Draper, State Commissioner of
Education, Hon. Henry W. Hoefer, State Architect, Major-General
John F. O’Ryan, Adjutant-General William Verbeck and Hon. James
A. Holden, State Historian, Hon. John A. Bensel, State Engineer and
Surveyor, to prominent members of the State Legislature, to Justice
Charles E. Hughes, former Governor of New York, to Hon. George
H. Prouty, former Governor of Vermont, to Col. Calvin D. Cowles,
to Hon. Frank S. Witherbee, President of the Champlain Association,
to Percival Wilds, Secretary of that Association, to Mr.
Stephen H. P. Pell, to Hon. James A. Roberts, President of the New
York State Historical Association, to Frederick B. Richards, Secretary
of the New York State Historical Association, to Dr. George F. Kunz,
President of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society, to
Hon. Charles B. Alexander, to Hon. McDougall Hawkes, to Carl A.
Heber, the sculptor, to Paul Faguet of the French Line, to Hon. William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Cary Sanger, to Hon. Francis Lynde Stetson, Hon. Robert Roberts, to
Hon. Job E. Hedges, to President Guy Potter Benton, LL. D., of the
University of Vermont, to President John M. Thomas, D. D., of Middlebury
College, to President Charles H. Spooner, Ph. D., of Norwich
University, and to others, in addition to the invitations sent to members of
the New York and Vermont Tercentenary Commissions, and to some
prominent citizens of Vermont.</p>

<p>The special invitations included in most instances the ladies of the
gentlemen so invited and they were present at all the exercises.</p>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Lake Champlain Association through
its Secretary, Percival Wilds, sent to its members notice they were invited
to the dedicatory exercises and to accompany the guests on the
steamer “<i>Ticonderoga</i>” through the lake.</p>

<p>President Frank S. Witherbee and many members of the Association
were present at the dedicatory ceremonies of the Crown Point and the
Plattsburgh memorials. The officers and members of the Lake Champlain
Association took a deep interest in the Tercentenary celebration
and from time to time rendered assistance to the Tercentenary Commissioners
in various ways, and especially so in assuming the responsibility
and conduct of the banquet to the French delegation at the Waldorf-Astoria
in New York City on May 1, 1912.</p>

<p>In arranging for the dedicatory exercises, no effort was made to
augment the attendance, nor to rival in elaboration the programme of the
Tercentenary celebration of 1909.</p>

<p>All that remained on this occasion for the Lake Champlain Tercentenary
Commissioners to do was to turn over formally to the properly
constituted authorities the Champlain memorials, which had been constructed
pursuant to law at Crown Point Forts and at Plattsburgh. The
exercises, therefore, were planned with that end in view. They were
dignified and stately, but did not extend beyond the formal presentation
and acceptances of the memorials as will appear from the record that
follows. The President, Vice-President, United States Senators,
Foreign Ambassadors and some other specially invited guests were unable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
to attend on account of the prolonged second session of the Sixty-second
Congress, or absence from the country, at the time of the dedicatory
ceremonies, to the regret of the members of the Commissions and the
people of the Champlain valley. The participation of these officials of
the United States, France and Great Britain in the Tercentenary exercises
had added national as well as international stateliness to that commemorative
celebration, still fresh in the memory of all who chanced to
witness it. The unavoidable absence of these distinguished guests was
in a measure compensated for, however, in the presence of their representatives,
who contributed much to the success of the dedicatory ceremonies.
All arrangements were carried forward for the dedication of
the Crown Point memorial by Commissioners Witherbee, Knapp, Pell,
Lafontaine and Shea with all the forethought and care that had characterized
their painstaking efforts from the first. Commissioner Hill,
and President John M. Thomas of the Vermont Commission
planned the programme and secured the speakers. Commissioners Booth,
Riley, Weaver and Knapp were no less vigilant in preparing for the
dedicatory ceremonies of the Plattsburgh Champlain Memorial. In
this they were materially assisted by the mayor of the city, the Chamber
of Commerce and the people of Plattsburgh as well as by Colonel Calvin
D. Cowles of the Fifth U. S. Infantry, stationed at Plattsburgh Barracks.
The people of Plattsburgh purchased and improved the site for
the Champlain memorial, decorated the streets for the dedicatory exercises,
provided automobiles for the visitors to make a tour of the city
and aided the Tercentenary Commissioners in other ways in carrying to
a successful conclusion the dedicatory ceremonies.</p>

<p>The attendance at both the Crown Point and the Plattsburgh exercises
was thoroughly representative of the people of the Champlain valley,
though not as large as at the Tercentenary exercises. The steamer
“<i>Ticonderoga</i>” was chartered by the New York Tercentenary Commission
and brought the invited guests from Plattsburgh, Burlington and
Port Henry. After the exercises at Crown Point Forts, the “<i>Ticonderoga</i>”
took the guests back to their several destinations and the members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
of the Tercentenary Commissions to Bluff Point, where they registered
at the new Hotel Champlain.</p>

<p>The military features of the dedicatory ceremonies are given in the
following report of the Military Committee:</p>


<p>The military features of the ceremonies attending the dedication of
the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse at Crown Point, N. Y., July 5,
1912, and the unveiling of the Statue of Champlain at Plattsburgh,
N. Y., July 6, 1912, were on a much smaller scale than those of the
celebration of 1909, but the presence of the United States and State
troops added greatly to the dignity of the ceremonies at both places.
When the chartered steamboat “<i>Ticonderoga</i>” left the dock at Port
Henry at 11:30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, July 5th, Governor John A. Dix and the following
members of his staff were on board:</p>

<h3 id="PartII_II">II. UNVEILING TABLET AT THE ENGLISH FORT.</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">Upon reaching Crown Point Forts, a tablet was unveiled on the
walls of the old Barracks at the English fort, built by General
Amherst and occasionally called “Fort Amherst,” by members
of the Society of Colonial Wars, which was witnessed by the Champlain
Commissioners and the large assemblage of people. The following
report of the Tablet Committee is of historical interest:</p>


<h4>REPORT OF THE TABLET COMMITTEE</h4>

<p>To the members of the Society of Colonial Wars, in the State of New
York, your committee beg to report that the tablet has been designed,
cast and erected on the walls of the old Barracks at Fort Amherst in
the State Reservation at Crown Point, New York.</p>

<p>The design was drawn and the details of modeling were carried out
under the supervision of Mr. Walter B. Chambers, of the committee.
The sculptor who made the Tablet was Mr. Herman Wurth.</p>

<p>The tablet was unveiled with appropriate ceremony on Friday, July 5,
1912, on the occasion of the dedication of the Champlain Memorial
Lighthouse, erected by the states of New York and Vermont, at
Crown Point, N. Y.</p>

<p>The members of the Society were guests of the Tercentenary Commissions
on the steamboat “<i>Ticonderoga</i>,” leaving Port Henry, New
York. At 11:30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> on the day mentioned, and on landing at Crown
Point, a procession was formed and led by the Port Henry Band, and
an escort of Company “I,” 2d Regiment, N. G., N. Y., and Company
“M,” N. G., Vt., Governor Dix and staff, Adjutant-General Tillotson
and staff, representing Governor John A. Mead, of Vermont.</p>

<p>Major-General John F. O’Ryan, N. G., N. Y., Count and Countess
de Peretti de la Rocca, and Mr. Maugras, representing the French
Embassy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Members of the New York and Vermont Champlain Tercentenary
Commission, Colonel William Cary Sanger, Governor of our Society,
Frederick B. Richards, Dr. Reynolds Webb Wilcox, George G.
Reynolds, Stephen H. P. Pell, and other members of the Society, and
about one hundred invited guests marched from the wharf to the English
Fort built under Amherst, where the tablet was handsomely decorated
with American flags guarded by a soldier of the 2d Regiment.</p>

<p>Hon. Howland Pell, your chairman, called the meeting to order, and
stated that the committee had finished its task, and asked Miss Evelyn
Witherbee to unveil the tablet. As this was done the band played the
National air, the troops came to attention, and the audience of several
thousand applauded. Its inscription showed that the tablet was erected
by the Society of Colonial Wars in commemoration of the erection of
the Fortress by Amherst and capture of Fort St. Frédéric.</p>

<p>The chairman then introduced Col. William Cary Sanger, who in a
few well chosen words presented the tablet to the State of New York.
Governor Dix then made a brief address, accepting the Tablet and
placed it in the custody of the New York Historical Association in
charge of the Reservation. Mr. James A. Holden, Treasurer, and Mr.
Frederick B. Richards, Secretary, of the Association, accepted the
charge and made short addresses. Judge Pyrke, of Port Henry, chairman
of the local committee, promised to see that the tablet would be
well cared for. The tablet bears the following inscription:</p>

<p>The tablet is of the finest bronze, 30 by 24 inches in size, and represents
a soldier of the Black Watch, and a provincial soldier holding a
scroll of inscription. General Sir Jeffrey Amherst’s head is in the upper

the English forts, and a list of the English and American regiments in the
campaign is given.</p>

<h4 class="smcap fs100">Address of Acceptance of Tablet by James Austin Holden, State
Historian and Treasurer, New York State Historical
Association</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The tablet was formally accepted for the New York State Historical Association
by State Historian James A. Holden of Glens Falls, who is ex-officio a member
of the committee in charge of the Crown Point Reservation, as well as Treasurer
of the New York State Historical Association. He spoke briefly as follows:</p>

<p><em>Your Excellency</em>, <em>Tercentenary Commissioners</em>, <em>Representatives of New York and
of Vermont</em>, <em>of France</em>, <em>of Patriotic and Historical Societies</em>, <em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em>:
It is with great pleasure that I accept on behalf of the New York Historical Association,
the official custodians of the Crown Point Reservation, this beautiful and
distinctive tablet which has just been presented by the Society of Colonial Wars to
the State of New York, through you, its Governor.</p>

<p>It is especially gratifying to the Association to receive it from your hands, for it
is to you, and your broad and patriotic conception of the duties of the chief executive
of the State, that our hearty thanks are due for the generous and welcome local
appropriations which you lately have approved, making so largely for the preservation,
the maintenance and popularity of the reservation.</p>

<p>On this torrid July day whose sun’s rays reflected from these crumbling walls are
full as deadly as any of the bullets which blazed forth at them in days of old, my
words of acceptance must be brief indeed.</p>

<p>This expressive addition, then, to these historic walls, whose story is rife with
actions of emprise and derring-do, around which still hover the historic spirits of the
olden wars, connected with which are the inspiring deeds of the knightly souls of
Montcalm and Amherst, of Warner and Burgoyne, yes, even of Arnold the patriot,
not yet the traitor, full of the memories of the now shadowy hosts of white coated
Bourbons, the red attired British, and the buff and blue covered Revolutionists, we
accept and assure your Excellency that it shall be our earnest endeavor to prove
worthy in every way of the confidence reposed in us in making this Association the
State’s representative for this reservation.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Association I now turn over to the Secretary of the Association
the formal care of the tablet, thanking once more your Excellency and all who
have been concerned in the presentation of this memorial, for giving to the Association
this further opportunity to prove its historical usefulness, and to justify its
being, and for providing this occasion to exemplify practically the purposes for
which it was founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>Frederick B. Richards, Secretary of the New York State Historical
Association, at the unveiling of the tablet at Crown Point Forts, N. Y.,
July 5, 1912, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I supplement State Historian Holden because I feel that it will take at least
two to make up for the absence of our esteemed President, Ex-Comptroller Roberts,
who was to have represented the New York State Historical Association this
morning.</p>

<p>We feel deeply honored that the State has designated our Association as custodians
of this reservation. We are still further honored by being entrusted with
this beautiful tablet, erected by the Society of Colonial Wars, which, linking as
it does the past with the present, adds to the interest of these old ruins.</p>

<p>I will not detain you longer this morning except to call your attention to one
feature of the tablet in which I am particularly interested. You will notice that
the list of the regiments is supported on the left by a Highlander, a private of the
Royal Highlanders as they were known in this campaign, otherwise called the
42d, “Old Forty-Twa,” or the Black Watch.</p>

<p>The Black Watch, the oldest Highland regiment in the British Army and one
of the regiments under Amherst who helped to build this old fort, was selected for
this place of honor because of its unparalleled gallantry in the assault on Fort Ticonderoga
under General Abercromby the year before, in which engagement it lost 646,
killed and wounded, out of a total strength of a thousand men who went into action,
or a mortality of twice that of the Light Brigade at Balaklava, immortalized by
Tennyson.</p>

<h3 id="PartII_III">III. DEDICATORY CEREMONIES OF CHAMPLAIN
MEMORIAL LIGHTHOUSE AT CROWN POINT
FORTS JULY 5, 1912</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">At the appointed hour for the dedicatory ceremonies at Crown Point
Forts on July 5, 1912, a large multitude had assembled from the
Champlain valley and from the two states to witness the exercises.</p>

<p>Seated on the temporary platform in front of the Champlain Memorial
Lighthouse were: Colonel William Cary Sanger, representing the
President of the United States, Count de Peretti de la Rocca, representing
the French Ambassador, Governor John A. Dix of New York,
Adjutant-General Lee S. Tillotson, representing the Governor of Vermont,
and Commissioners H. Wallace Knapp, Chairman; Henry W.
Hill, Secretary; Walter C. Witherbee, Treasurer; Senator James A.
Foley, Judge John B. Riley, Judge John H. Booth, James Shea, Louis
C. Lafontaine, Howland Pell and William R. Weaver of the New
York Tercentenary Commission; and Lynn M. Hays, Secretary; Judge
Frank L. Fish, Treasurer; President John M. Thomas, Walter H.
Crockett, George T. Jarvis, William J. Van Patten, Arthur F. Stone
and F. O. Beaupre of the Vermont Lake Champlain Tercentenary
Commission, and the speakers, invited guests and others.</p>

<p>The memorial as already stated was not complete in that the bronze
statuary group was represented by the models, as the bronze work had
not been put in position. That did not detract, however, from the artistic
features of the memorial, which were much admired by the assembled
multitude. The platform and memorial were artistically decorated with
the flags of the United States.</p>

<p>The programme at the dedicatory ceremonies was the following:</p>

<p>Hon. H. Wallace Knapp, Chairman of the New York Lake Champlain
Tercentenary Commission, presided:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>The exercises were opened with appropriate music by the Sherman
Military Band of Burlington, Vermont. The following Invocation was
then pronounced by Rev. Lewis Francis, D.D., of New York City.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we invoke Thy blessing as we are gathered
here to dedicate a monument which has been erected in commemoration of the discoveries
and achievements of one whose name is borne by the beautiful lake on
whose shores we are assembled.</p>

<p>We thank Thee for his heroism and his faith, for his loyalty to his beloved
country and his devotion to God. We thank Thee for his desire not only to plant
the standard of France upon the land which he had discovered, but also to uplift
the cross upon it. We thank Thee for the friendship which has existed for many
years between the two countries which are represented here to-day. May this
monument, erected by our country in memory of one of the heroes of France, be a
fresh token of this friendship.</p>

<p>Let Thy blessing rest upon the two States which have united in making this dedication
possible. May this monument by its stability remind us of those strong and
enduring qualities of character which should mark us as nations and individuals.
May the light which shall shine forth from its summit be a symbol of the light of
knowledge and of truth which as States and Nations we should seek to give the
world, which may be both a guide and a warning; and may it bring Him to our
thought, who is the Light of the world, that walking in His Light we may be guided
aright through every peril of our lives.</p>

<p>May the blessing of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost
rest upon the States and Nations here represented, and upon all of us who have
assembled here to celebrate this glad event.</p>

<p>And this we ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/fp134.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">Champlain Memorial Lighthouse, July 5, 1912</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then followed the formal unveiling of the Champlain Memorial
Lighthouse by Miss Louise G. Witherbee, daughter of Commissioner
Walter C. Witherbee, as the patriotic strains of the Star Spangled
Banner were being played by the Port Henry Band. As the memorial
was exposed to full view, its symmetry and beauty provoked the applause
of the admiring spectators, who thus saw the fulfillment of their long
cherished hopes, that there be erected in the Valley a stately memorial
to Samuel Champlain. Chairman Knapp, in speaking for the New York<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Tercentenary Commission, thereupon formally presented the memorial to
the Governor of New York. In doing so he spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In obedience to the authorization of the Federal Government, the Commissions
of the States of Vermont and New York have erected on the lands of the United
States of America, adjacent to the Crown Point Reservation, the specified memorial
of the discovery of the Champlain valley, and are now acting in the discharge of
their final duties, with the sincere feeling of gratification that a task so honorable
has been brought to so happy an ending.</p>

<p>Our duty has been to do, rather than to speak, and yet it may not be wholly out
of place to give expression to the general thought, that the light of peace and safety,
that is to glow from this monument through an unreckoned future, replaces the
fitful fire of early war.</p>

<p>The shores that the discoverer scanned with painful daring are no longer dark
and solitary. He is no longer alone. The temptation to review the events of his
arrival here are strong, but time forbids, and to do so in detail must be left to the
official record. Nor need we in the discharge of our official functions attempt to
portray the full significance of the deed we now commemorate. We must wait till
the voice of history speaks, with the judgment of warriors and statesmen, with the
inspiration of poetry and the reverence of enlightened piety.</p>

<p>There seem to be moments in the life of every man, when he pauses in his career
to recall the past and seeks to peer into the future, and so it is appointed for us to do
to-day. While the daily rush of the outer world passes us by unheedingly in
appearance, it is yet not truly so. From the day of the first visit of the white man,
the eyes of the enlightened world have been upon the Champlain valley and the
attentive good will of all well-wishers of their kind who are with us now.</p>

<p>It can hardly be said that the present occasion marks the ending of an old epoch
or the beginning of a new one. Peace has reigned within our borders for a hundred
years. It marks rather the recognition of a century of peace as a harbinger of
still more harmonious conditions for all times between the peoples whose fathers
struggled here for mastery. It marks the welcoming of a new order of things in
which the old problems have met their just solution and in which the ancient grudge
is lost in charity. Standing here beside this monument to the past, and beacon of
the future, we know that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">God fulfills Himself in many ways,</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="p1 fs90 just">The old order changeth indeed when Vermont and New York live only in service
to the common good and together place above their monument the emblem of their
common country. It has long been so, but it was not always so. It is well, perhaps,
to remember the passing altercations, since they serve now only to demonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
how closely and firmly they have drawn together. Surely this water will run clear
and sweet between them and the light from the tower above all fall upon fraternal
shores. Vermont has done her duty, and her duty has been a labor of love. With
such a spirit sitting by our hearthstone, the future of the valley is secure.</div>

<p>In behalf of the Tercentenary Commission of the State of New York, I thank
the members of the Tercentenary Commission of the State of Vermont and all their
associates, for the efficiency of their co-operation in the labors that are now drawing
to a close.</p>

<p>Gentlemen of the Executive Departments of the States of Vermont and New
York, our task is done; the monument before us is at your disposal. In the name
of the New York Commission I want to thank you and your predecessors in office
for the aid you have given us, and the effective support we have received from you,
in the days of our perplexity and discouragement. If any shortcomings of ours
are to be remembered, kindly bear in mind that it was our heads and not our hearts
that went astray.</p>

<p>That these meetings of officials and citizens of the countries that are represented
here will be repeated, and that the spirit of peace and good will will continue for
all times is our sincere desire.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, in pursuance of the authority vested in the New York—Lake Champlain
Tercentenary Commission, we now transfer to your charge the Crown Point
Memorial Lighthouse.</p>
</div>

<p>President John M. Thomas, D.D., of Middlebury College, representing
the Vermont Tercentenary Commission, spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: In behalf of the freemen of Vermont,
and representing the Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commission of Vermont, I
have the honor to transfer to the representative of his Excellency, Governor John A.
Mead, this memorial of the discoverer of Lake Champlain and of the territory now
comprising the State of Vermont. This commemorative light-tower is erected on a
site made American soil forever by the valor of our Green Mountain sires. It is
our will that it shall stand as a reminder to succeeding generations of the honor in
which the men of the generation of the three hundredth anniversary of his discovery
held the intrepid navigator, the scholarly explorer, and the Christian pioneer,
Samuel Champlain.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Gov. John A. Dix speaking at Crown Point Memorial, July 5, 1912</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Gov. John A. Dix of New York, in accepting the memorial and
transferring it to the United States, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Fellow-Citizens of America, and Brethren of the World, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>:</p>

<p>This memorial to that great son of France, whose life and service we recall in
gratitude and honor to-day, is peculiarly appropriate and expressive.</p>

<p>Its foundation is grounded upon a rock, its aspect is magnificent, its position
commanding, and its work is for the lighting of the way of humanity. How well
it typifies the character and the deeds of Champlain! He had the firmness and the
constancy of the rock in his character, the beauty of the superstructure in his life,
and the persistency of the never-failing light in the operations of his mind and heart
for the service of his country and mankind.</p>

<p>The contrasts between his times and ours, the marvelous changes that have
almost entirely transformed man’s environment within the past three hundred years,
make it difficult if not impossible for us to-day properly to appreciate the soul-controlling
purposes of Champlain, or estimate the sacrifices he endured in the outworking
of those purposes.</p>

<p>Contemplation of Champlain, dreamer, discoverer and hero, is, however, for us a
stimulant to imagination and to ambition.</p>

<p>To praise him because of the results that followed through the work of other
men and later times, is as illogical as to disparage his character and work by
taking the viewpoint of the present without giving due consideration, so far as
people of our time can understand them, to the conditions and ideals of his age
and the obstacles that he had to overcome in all he achieved.</p>

<p>His journey hither may have been for conquest and not discovery. Upholders
of this opinion cite the fact that Champlain had with him and used the first
explosive death-dealing weapons seen by the Indians, and that wars between the
tribes followed.</p>

<p>Yet Indian wars were known before. Was not war the truest expression of
the savage nature? Was not the Long House of the Iroquois the greatest war
machine of the time? When in America was exploration free from combat, and
what was land discovery but conquest?</p>

<p>Let us receive from Samuel Champlain the inspiration of high aims and purpose
and unselfish service to our fellow-men. Let us dedicate ourselves to the
work so nobly begun by his indomitable will and fortitude in blazing the way for
the American spirit of courage and enterprise that so greatly enriched and developed
this northern country.</p>

<p>For me it is sufficient to know that Samuel Champlain was the first white
man here, and that the knowledge he gained was the first information that civilization
had regarding this wondrous place. Moreover, I know that he was the same man
whose mind conceived, as early as the year 1600, the utility and the plan of a ship
canal across the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>Facing almost insuperable difficulties at home and braving unknown obstacles
and dangers in the fabled New World, he made not only one or two, but, all told,
nine voyages across the Atlantic from his beloved France, exploring our coasts and
penetrating into the wilderness of our savage-ridden shores.</p>

<p>Everywhere he went, he planted the cross of his inherited faith and the ideals
of a Christian world.</p>

<p>Faith in God and in one’s self, achievement for our nation and our race, and the
power of imagination in dissolving all difficulties in the path of progress, are the
lessons that his life teaches.</p>

<p>To an American who treasures the traditions of his country and who reveres
the one nation of Europe that to the struggling patriots of the Revolution gave the
recognition and aid that won the day and established our independence, what
keener pleasure can come than on an occasion like this to welcome with heart and
hand the representatives of the great French nation? It was our own Jefferson
who truly said: “<span lang="fr">Tout homme a deux patries—la sienne et puis la France</span>.”</p>

<p>It is indeed a high honor to join hands with the representative of the State of
Vermont to bequeath to the Federal government for safe keeping and constant care
this noble memorial, with the hope that its never-failing light may guide the wayfarer
and the voyager on the path of safety.</p>

<p>To you, Colonel Sanger, this monument is now given. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>In the absence of Gov. John A. Mead of Vermont, who was detained
at home by slight illness, Adjt.-Gen. Lee S. Tillotson received
the memorial on behalf of the Governor of Vermont and in turn presented
it to the United States in the following address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: I think it should be
made plain that I am not the Governor of Vermont, otherwise my appearance as to
clothing might lead some to think that the Governor had exercised his constitutional
prerogative and with the consent of the Senate had assumed personal command of
the military forces of the State and had come over here to dispute New York’s
right to have this memorial located on New York soil. If this were true, it would
not be the first time that the “Green Mountain Boys” had invaded this shore of
Lake Champlain. However, no such hostile action is intended or necessary or
possible, for conditions have changed. This memorial has been erected and located
by the joint action of the Commissions of both States: New York and Vermont are
now a part of the same nation, both subject to the same national government in
whose custody this memorial is about to be placed, and from the United States of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
America neither New York nor Vermont will ever seek to take anything by force
of arms.</p>

<p>During the past few days, since I knew that I might be called upon to speak
for the Governor on this occasion, I have been endeavoring to keep up with my
everyday work, follow the events connected with the two great national political
conventions which have been held, and several other local political meetings, and at
the same time to accumulate in my mind the history of the past three hundred years.
This effort has resulted in a state of mind which culminated last night in a dream
in which it appeared to me that at the point in these ceremonies when Vermont’s
share in this memorial was about to be surrendered into the keeping of the representative
of the United States, there suddenly appeared on the scene one of the most
strenuous of the recently defeated national political candidates and demanded that
the Champlain Memorial be turned over to him as the only safe and rightful custodian
thereof.</p>

<p>I would be remiss in my duty on this occasion if I did not express to these Commissioners
Vermont’s appreciation of their efforts in carrying forward so successfully
this memorable celebration which is here completed in the dedication of this beautiful,
substantial and useful memorial. It is to be exceedingly regretted that Governor
Mead could not have been present in person at this ceremony to speak for our State.
In his absence, gentlemen of the Vermont Commission, the Governor directs me to
accept this memorial on behalf of the State of Vermont, and to assure you that
your task has been well performed and that your work merits, and will undoubtedly
receive, the approval of the people of Vermont.</p>

<p>There is one thought which I would like to express to you on this occasion.
We are all more or less influenced by the achievements of the past, and through
the energy and the daring of such men as Champlain, there probably does not now
remain on the earth any such unexplored wildernesses as was this valley when
Champlain first saw it; even the poles have been discovered and located. It remains
for us of the present and the future to make the best possible use of the advantages
which we have thus gained. Let us not sacrifice the beauties of this Champlain
Valley to the greed of commercialism. Let it be our effort, rather, to preserve
and conserve it in all the magnificence of its natural resources, so that it will remain
a haven of peace and rest to which the tired workers of the world may come for
recreation and gain thereby renewed energy and ambition for future explorations
into the still undiscovered realms of noble art, helpful literature, useful science and
honest business.</p>

<p>And now, by direction of the Governor of Vermont and in his name, our custody
in this Champlain Memorial is transmitted to the representative of the government
of the United States of America, to which, by this act, we again acknowledge our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
allegiance and pledge our support to the utmost extent of our resources. But while
this memorial is thus placed in the hands of the whole people of these United
States, I would remind you that the waters over which its light will shine will
continue to separate, yet unite the shores of New York and Vermont, to one of
which you must always come if you wish to see Champlain in all its beauty, and
to both of which, and especially to Vermont, you will always be welcome.
(Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>President William H. Taft was unable to be present and commissioned
the Hon. William Cary Sanger of Sangerfield, former Assistant
Secretary of War of the United States, to receive the memorial on the
part of the United States and, in doing so, he spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These interesting ceremonies illustrate one of the great principles which the
founders of our country and the framers of our Constitution so wisely made a
fundamental part of our national life. To each State is left the care and supervision
of those matters which directly and exclusively concern the citizens of the
State, and thus individuality and initiative in the development of local spirit and
character, are stimulated and encouraged, but those matters which properly concern
the people as a whole are cared for by the representatives of the people in one
department or another of the National Government. The lighthouses are not only
for the use of those who live in their immediate vicinity, but they protect the interests
and they encourage the activities of all the people, and consequently they
have been placed under the control and care of the National Government.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Col. William Carey Sanger speaking at Crown Point Memorial, July 5, 1912</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was my pleasure on one occasion to hear President Eliot of Harvard University
deliver an address on the subject, “Democracy and Beauty.” At first the
title seemed strange, but before President Eliot had finished it was apparent to
everyone who heard him that it is a privilege, as well as a duty, for those who
constitute a democracy to see to it that what is beautiful in nature, in art, and in
architecture, should, so far as possible, be brought within such easy reach of the
people that the pleasure and benefit which come from beauty may be theirs. This
lighthouse marks a step forward in a most important direction. It is true that
our public buildings and our private residences and our parks have been growing
more and more beautiful under the careful work of those who are responsible for
them, but this is the first instance in which an attempt has been made to make a
lighthouse a thing of beauty. For this, those responsible for its construction and
the architect and the sculptor are entitled to our most grateful appreciation. The
lighthouse will be none the less useful to the mariner and will be vastly more valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
to the community because architect and sculptor have united to make it so
attractive and interesting that it is a pleasure to look at it.</p>

<p>This light will not only guide those who voyage on these waters, but we can
see in it and in all those other lights which mark our coasts and the harbors of our
inland seas a symbol of what our national life should be, not only for our people
but for the entire world. The lighthouse guides to the desired haven; it warns against
shoals; in the dark and in the storm it enables the mariner to find his way in safety
past the perils which threaten him. There is storm on land as well as on sea; there
are in our national life perplexities and dangers; amid the turmoil of our political,
business and social activities there is the right course which leads to the well-being
of our people, and there are rocks of error and wrong which threaten with peril
or destruction those who do not avoid them. May these lighthouses serve their
useful and beneficent purpose, and may the light of liberty and truth burn so
brightly that our country, through stress and storm, may see its way clear to such
a course of national life as will bring to us the full rewards and blessings of a
national life well lived and wisely directed.</p>

<p>It is indeed a disappointment to us all, as well as to the President himself, that
he has not been able to be present to-day. He has honored me by asking me to
represent him, and on his behalf I accept for the Government of the United States
this light, and assure you that it will ever burn to serve the splendid purpose for
which you have created it. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>Chairman Knapp then presented Count de Peretti de la Rocca, Chargé
d’Affaires de France, who, in the absence of the French Ambassador,
represented the Republic of France, and spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall not speak to you about Champlain; you know more about him than I.
Everything around here reminds you of him. And so many speakers more eloquent,
members of the French Academy, Ambassadors, Senators, Governors of States,
have told you of his spirit of enterprise, his courage, his energy, his force of character,
his uprightness of heart. What could I add to their discourses?</p>

<p>But I shall tell you how delighted I am to represent here the French Ambassador.
My pleasure is as great as his would have been to be present. Mr. Jusserand
told me many times how happy he was to commemorate on similar occasions
the beginnings of this country, because the name of France is associated so often
with these celebrations by which you Americans show, with such admirable perseverance,
your remembrance of the past.</p>

<p>To-day you celebrate the memory of a brave French pioneer who, foreseeing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
future, discovered and opened up a beautiful country to the knowledge of mankind
and to civilization. Some years ago you raised monuments to the leaders who
came with the military power of France to fight for the freedom of your country.</p>

<p>On another occasion, for your gratitude is considerate, you did honor to the
memory of the French private soldiers and sailors who fell in the War of Independence
and whose names were forgotten. But they shed their blood on this soil
where liberty sprang forth, your country, and you wished that a beautiful monument
at Annapolis should recall to posterity the memory of those modest heroes.</p>

<p>All these commemorations find an echo on the other side of the ocean, in the
sister Republic. They make up other links added to the long chain of friendship
which binds our two countries. They induce Frenchmen to cross the sea, like
Champlain, impelled by the curiosity of new things, and they discover America.
At first they are astonished; they did not expect to see what they see in this country,
where three centuries before only explorers dared to venture. And they return to
France, like the delegates who came here recently on behalf of the France-Amérique
Committee, impressed not only with the future of the United States but with their
present, with their unheard of development which surprises our old customs, and
they bring back from this young and already great country a store of new ideas.</p>

<p>As Americans who know Paris like to return there, Frenchmen who once come
to the United States wish to come back again; for we have much to learn the one
from the other. Let us, therefore, see each other as much as possible: the more
we shall know each other, the better we shall like each other. History encourages
us to do so; our mutual interests recommend us to do likewise. Thank God, if
so many Americans are the worthy descendants of the heroes of the Revolutionary
War, there are yet in France many men of the type of Champlain, with the
same energy, the same eagerness for knowledge, the same uprightness. These are
characteristics of the race in that old France, always young, of which one of our
best artists has portrayed the features in bronze so that you may see them there, in
the midst of you, under the shadow of the memorial to a great Frenchman, who,
like all Frenchmen coming over here, loved America. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Chairman then introduced the orator of the day, the Hon. Robert
Roberts, LL. D., Mayor of Burlington, Vermont, who delivered the
following scholarly address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Governor Dix, Members of the Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions,
Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: This memorial having been presented and received with
due ceremony, it would seem that the purpose for which we are assembled had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
been accomplished and that a motion to adjourn would be in order. But a programme,
like a table of contents, is a tyrannous thing, and if a place therein is
marked for an address it must be filled.</p>
</div>

</figure>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I suppose this to be the last but one of the events connected with the Champlain
Tercentenary. During the celebration, in 1909, as appears from the admirable
and voluminous Report of the Commission, the dramatic history of this lake and
its borderlands has been unfolded and illustrated in full detail by antiquarians,
men of letters, orators, statesmen, poets, and prelates. Among the many representative
speakers from official life were the President of the United States, the
Ambassador from England, the Ambassador from France, certain high officials
from the Dominion of Canada, the Governor of New York, a United States Senator
from New York, the Governor of Vermont, and the Congressmen from that State.
It may, therefore, be assumed, and the fact is, that those of us who speak to-day
may not be harvesters but only gleaners in this fruitful field of local history and
there is little left to garner for your store.</p>

<p>But shall we leave this stern and rock-bound structure to stand cold and stark
and chained to a thankless service in shedding abroad its light for the warning
and comfort of men without some simple rite of baptism? Shall we abandon this
sweetly serious embodiment of French womanhood to face, unveiled, the tempest,
the heat of summer and the frost of winter without a word of benediction and
without some act of homage which is her due and which she is wont to receive
from the gallant men of her own blood? It is true, she is well able to face undaunted
the buffeting of hostile circumstance. Such has been her fate for centuries.
In coarse apparel she has tilled the fields and kept her house, and by the
proceeds of her thrift has ransomed a nation. She has seen visions, and under the
inspiration of heavenly voices, and clad in mail, she has led armies and raised the
siege of a city. She has fought behind barricades, and with heroic dignity has
bared her fair throat to the guillotine. With gaiety unquenched, she has starved
through the investment of her beloved Paris. Through sore privation she has
won a name in art, in science, and in letters. She embodies the just combination
of qualities which make for fineness, elasticity, strength, health and long life. So,
with hands upon our hearts—to La Belle France, salutation and blessing! May
she, joined together with her strong protectors, the great explorer, his man-at-arms
and his Indian guide, long remain to figure forth the beautiful in art in this setting of
the beautiful in nature.</p>

<p>The historical incidents which I may touch upon are such as occurred in the
neighborhood of Crown Point and Ticonderoga and the fortresses which guarded
the southern gateway of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>It is generally agreed that Champlain and his allies fought their first battle
against the Iroquois somewhere in this vicinity. From his naïve story of the encounter
it appears that primitive man dearly loves to bandy words and to fight.
As the Homeric heroes, when face to face in combat, interchanged long and high
sounding speeches before falling to, so did the rival war parties in 1609. Champlain’s
account says that when his men “were armed and in array, they sent two
canoes, set apart from the others, to learn from their enemies if they wanted to
fight. They replied that they wanted nothing else but that; at the moment there
was not much light and they must wait for the daylight to recognize each other,
and that as soon as the sun rose they would open the battle. This was accepted
by our men; and while we waited, the whole night was passed in dances and
songs, as much on one side as on the other, with endless insults and other talk, such
as the little courage we had, our feeble men and inability to make resistance against
their arms, and that when we came we should find it to our ruin. Our men were
also not lacking in retort, telling them that they should see such power of arms as
never before, and amid such other talk as is customary in the siege of a city.”
Champlain, at the head of his men, fired the first shot with his arquebuse and
killed two of the chiefs, mortally wounding a third. The writer evidently thought
his account of the marvellous efficacy of his weapon of precision needed explanation,
and adds that he loaded with four bullets. It would be fair to expect that
one bullet would go wild.</p>

<p>It would be interesting if we could have the story of this fight from the Iroquois
point of view. What impression did the outlandish pale-faces make upon the
defending band of aborigines? What was their judgment as to the ethics of the
invasion into their territory? We can well picture their demoralization upon the
sudden killing of their three chiefs. But can sophisticated imagination fully grasp
the degree of terror inspired by the bang of the guns of the explorers which broke
the silence of the forest primeval? What do we know of that awful stillness? The
Indian moved with catlike tread. The dip of his paddle made but a ripple.
His arrow sped to its mark without sound. The life and death struggle for the
survival of the fittest in the natural world went on about him in a silence broken
only by the stifled squeak of a victim or the crunching of bones. The show of
force in animate nature following patient waiting and reserve was swift and terrific,
but silent—the swoop of the eagle upon its prey, the spring of the panther, the
strike of the adder. The music of the denizens of the wilderness depended for
its quality upon the general absence of sound above that of the waterfall or the
rustling of leaves. Its various elemental strains—the hoot of the owl, the yell of
the loon, the miaul of the panther, the redman’s love call, war cry and death song—all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
soared high above the symphony of inanimate nature. One modern political
convention makes more noise in a day than the Indian ever heard through the centuries.
Thrice and four times happy Iroquois!</p>

<p>For a century more or less after the discovery of the lake, there were bloody
forays, without decisive results, back and forth between the French and Algonquins
on the North and the English and Iroquois on the South.</p>

<p>In 1731 the French fortified a post here at Crown Point and called it Fort
Frédéric. This was only a small stockade designed to accommodate thirty men.
It gave place to a fortress large enough for 120 men, and in 1742 it was enlarged
and strengthened, being then, with the exception of Quebec, the strongest French
fortress in America. And under the protection of this fortress was the largest of
the early settlements. Another small fort was constructed at Chimney Point opposite
here, and about it groups of home seekers were gathered. All settlements in
this neighborhood disappeared as soon as the French soldiers withdrew from Lake
Champlain.</p>

<p>War was not formally declared between Great Britain and France until 1756.
In that year was completed Fort Carillon (at Ticonderoga), about 200 men being
employed in its construction. In 1759, in face of siege operations by Lord Amherst,
the French abandoned the fort, retired to Fort Frédéric, evacuated and blew
up this fort and retired to Canada. Thus, after a full century and a half of more
or less interrupted control, French supremacy passed from Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>Here, at Crown Point, Amherst thereupon constructed at enormous expense a
new fortress, the principal function of which has been to make a picturesque ruin
and a pleasant picnic ground for the people of the present day.</p>

<p>The blood-soaked slopes of this great waterway were hardly dry before the
war between Great Britain and her American colonies broke out and these strategic
points on the lake, which were vital as buttresses against invasion by French and
Indians from Canada, became equally so to the colonists for safeguarding the
valley from British occupation.</p>

<p>Crown Point and Ticonderoga again became the center of interest and activity.
The local patriots determined to seize Fort Ticonderoga and learned that the
Green Mountain Boys were, as they expressed it, “the proper persons to do the
job.” The story of the surprise and capture of the fort by Ethan Allen and his
party of eighty-three men is authentic. The verbal form of his command to surrender
“in the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress” has
been questioned, but it is quite in the style of his other sayings and his writings.
Listen to his address to his little band before the attack:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Friends and fellow soldiers, you have for a number of years past been a scourge
and terror to arbitrary powers. Your valor has been famed abroad and acknowledged,
as appears by the advice and orders to me from the General Assembly of
Connecticut to surprise and take the garrison now before us. I now propose to
advance before you, and, in person, conduct you through the wicket gate; for
this morning either we quit our pretensions to valor or possess ourselves of this
fortress in a few minutes; and inasmuch as it is a desperate attempt, which none
but the bravest of men dare undertake, I do not urge it on any contrary to his will.
You that will undertake, voluntarily, poise your firelocks!”</p>

<p>Allen was a primitive man, a pioneer and land speculator. Like the Homeric
heroes and the Iroquois and Algonquin chiefs, he indulged in high and mighty talk
before the attack. In his day and among his people the accomplishment of formal
speech and writing was not common and lent distinction to its possessor, and Allen
was a man to let his light shine in this direction.</p>

<p>Ticonderoga witnessed the first lowering of His Majesty’s colors in the War
for Independence. Allen says of this occasion: “The sun seemed to rise that
morning with a superior lustre and Ticonderoga and all its defenders smiled on its
conquerors who tossed about the flowing bowl and wished success to Congress and
the liberty and freedom of America.”</p>

<p>Shortly after, Seth Warner and his men captured the small garrison here at
Crown Point together with 200 pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>In the struggle for supremacy of the Lake Champlain district men fought not
only for the glory of France and her religion, the glory of England and the spread
of her institutions, the independence of the Colonies and the abrogation of unjust
taxes, but also, and chiefly, as settlers, for the protection of their homes and the
validity of their land titles. They struggled, nevertheless, blindly, as all men do,
and were the instruments of forces and the larger design of which they could have
no vision. Notwithstanding her courage, superior leadership and organization,
France was defeated because, as has been said, “a new nation had arrived too
great in numbers, in extent of territory, in strength of independent, individual character
to be overwhelmed.”</p>

<p>A nation may be the loser in the game of war, but a great race can hardly be
subjugated or rubbed out. Quebec was taken, but the Province of Quebec is
French, and New England, through immigration, is slowly becoming New France.
Scotland and Ireland were conquered long ago, but the Scotch and Irish are
conspicuously present with us to-day. It has been easy for the western Powers to
blow up the forts of China and gain concessions, and the Chinese smile, seemingly
acquiesce, and kotow, but in all things essential to themselves they yield nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
but go their own way. A few Chinese boys trained in American colleges have
exerted a greater influence upon China than all the gunpowder ever manufactured
could do.</p>

<p>It would seem that there are forces visibly at work that make for peace, and this
in spite of the bloody history of man and the huge armaments which may mean the
fear of war rather than the love of it. Possibly it was from a willingness or even
a desire to move in harmony with such forces that Great Britain, France, the
Dominion of Canada and the United States of America found that without effort
or affectation they could find in the Champlain Tercentenary an occasion for the
interchange of words of pleasantness along the paths of international peace.</p>

<p>In the future, then, let celebrants of the Tercentenary events settle all their
differences by a joint meeting by the sweet waters of Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>Men draw from the pages of history different conclusions, for they read with
different eyes. Although we are familiar with the fact and the doctrine of the
spread of civilization through violence, yet in the concomitants of war, its pomps
and trappings, its glory and shame, its burnings and killings, its famine and pestilence,
its bickerings and jealousies, its graft and greed and sordidness, its futility
to effect its original purpose or to accomplish the greatest good, and more particularly
in the nature of men and things, may there not be some among us who find
warrant for the beatitude, “Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth.”
(Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>The ceremonies concluded with the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Benediction by Rev. J. W. Dwyer, of Ludlow, Vt.</p>

<p>O God, from whom are holy desires, right counsels and just works, give unto
Thy servants that peace which Thou hast told us the world cannot give; that our
hearts being given to the keeping of Thy commandments and the fear of enemies
being removed, our days, by Thy protection, may be peaceful.</p>

<p>May the blessings of Almighty God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost descend upon
all here assembled, upon all whom we represent, and abide with us forever. Amen.</p>
</div>

<p>The large assemblage, including many distinguished citizens from
Vermont, then dispersed to their several homes, except the Commissioners
and their guests, who boarded the “<i>Ticonderoga</i>” for Plattsburgh and
intermediate ports.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 id="PartII_IV">IV. SAIL DOWN THE LAKE TO BLUFF POINT</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The first stop was at Port Henry, one of the five gateways to the
Adirondacks and one of the large iron-ore ports of the country.
This picturesque village, nestling under the foothills of the
Adirondacks, the home of Commissioner Walter C. Witherbee and
Hon. Frank S. Witherbee, overlooks the lake, the Champlain Memorial
Lighthouse and historical Chimney Point on the Vermont shore. In
this town is located the principal office of Witherbee, Sherman &amp; Company,
extensive iron producers and donors to the State of New York of
the lands on which are situated the Crown Point Forts. It has a public
library and other public buildings, churches, etc. The steamer then proceeded
northward past Westport and Essex, attractive summer resorts
on the west shore of the lake and also past Thompson’s Point, Cedar
Beach and other resorts on the east shore of the lake to Burlington,
which rises above the blue waters of the lake in some such manner as
does Naples above the blue Mediterranean. It has its beautiful semicircular
bay with its two arms, projecting far out into the lake, similar
to the beautiful bay of Naples with its Sorrento and Posilipo, projecting
far out into the sea. It has its University, as has Naples, which has been
a center of learning and culture for many years. It rises less precipitously
and with more uniform gradation from the margin of the lake to the
college campus, where the University buildings crown the summit as
does the castle of St. Elmo the city of Naples. Its streets and avenues
are broader and better shaded than are those of Naples, but it has many
points of resemblance, which are suggestive of that rare Neapolitan fascination
not found elsewhere. Instead of the active and ever-threatening
Vesuvius, there rises in the background superbly beautiful Mt. Mansfield
silhouetted against the deep blue eastern sky. The commanding view
from the elevation of the University of Vermont to the eastward and
especially to the westward across the lake toward the rugged Adirondacks,
rising precipitously from the water’s edge to the sky line, is such
as to enable one to survey the width as well as something of the length<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
of the valley and appreciate its pictorial grandeur. As the sun gilds the
sky-pointing peaks and fills the valleys with rosy light, except where
drifting clouds cast their shadows athwart the mountain ranges and as the
placid waters of the lake reflect the overarching azure sky, in an atmosphere—the
clarity of which like that on the summit of Salvatore
accentuates nature’s beauties,—one is reminded that the Champlain
valley presents many views worthy the brush of a Turner, a Corot or
a Cormon. In the poem on “Lake Champlain” by S. S. Cutting,
D. D., will be found the following:</p>

Port Kent, one of the gateways to the Adirondacks. On the right were
seen some of the beautiful islands described by Samuel Champlain. One

<p>The steamer passed Valcour, where occurred one of the principal
naval engagements of the Revolution, in which Benedict Arnold distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
himself for his daring and for his adroit escape in the night
from the enemy. The Commissioners and their guests were landed at
Bluff Point and took rooms in the new Hotel Champlain, which was
built on the site of the former Hotel Champlain, burned in the winter
of 1910. Its commodious apartments, broad verandas and commanding
outlook over Cumberland Bay and the lake were admiringly appreciated
after the strenuous day’s exercises at Crown Point Forts and the ride
down the lake.</p>


<h4>CHAMPLAIN HOTEL, BLUFF POINT, JULY 6, 1912.</h4>

<p>The rosy-fingered dawn was eloquent with the loud, rich, skilfully
modulated song of the thrasher and the melody of the many birds that
frequent the tree-clad slopes along the shores of the lake. Nature has
with profusion bestowed her inexhaustible wealth of beauty in and about
Lake Champlain. The site of the new hotel at Bluff Point is one of the
places where this may be seen to advantage. As one gazes on the blue
waters of the lake, with its picturesque islands, stretching far away toward
the Vermont shores and over to the sloping hillsides that lead up to the
majestic Green Mountains in the distance and then to the towering
Adirondacks that wall in the lake on the west, he is quite apt to compare
the scene with that unfolded to the tourist, who looks out from Locarno
on the expanse of the blue waters of Lago Maggiore with its charming
islands and the encircling mountains, crowned with villas and historic
castles, “a perfect efflorescence of loveliness.” The grandeur and sublimity
of the Alpine scene is to some extent compensated for by the
broader expanse of undulating waters, the larger sweep of productive
valleys and verdant slopes, “set with the homes of men,” breathing the
air of freedom, whose heritage is liberty under law.</p>

<p>Amid such scenes the words of William Watson occur to one,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h3 id="PartII_V">V. CALL AT THE SUMMER SCHOOL, REVIEW OF
THE FIFTH INFANTRY REGIMENT, U. S. A., AT
PLATTSBURGH BARRACKS, TOUR OF THE
CITY, RECEPTION GIVEN BY THE HON. SMITH
M. WEED AND LUNCHEON AT THE FOUQUET HOUSE</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The morning hours quickly passed and the Champlain Commissioners
and their guests were waited upon by a delegation of
citizens of Plattsburgh.</p>

<p>The Commissioners, Governor Dix, Count de Peretti de la Rocca,
and other guests left the Hotel Champlain in automobiles at 10 o’clock,
under the escort of the Reception Committee of the Chamber of Commerce
of Plattsburgh, headed by Mayor Andrew G. Senecal. They
were driven to the Catholic Summer School at Cliff Haven, where they
were formally received by Rev. Father D. J. Hickey, President of the
Summer School, who delivered the following address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Your Excellency</em>: In the name of the trustees and patrons of the Catholic Summer
School of America I welcome you to Cliff Haven. Through eighteen years of
the twenty-one years of existence of this school we have been honored and inspired
by the visits of all the Presidents of the country from the lamented President
McKinley to the present President Taft. Through these years we have been also
visited by every Governor of the Empire State, and it has been our happy privilege
to extend to them the best reception possible. While we welcomed the Chief
Executives of our country with joy, it has always been our supreme pleasure to
welcome the Governors of our own state, as our school is under the charge of
the State Board of Regents over which you preside. We have found in their
visits an inspiration and encouragement in our educational work.</p>

<p>Your Excellency, I regret that your visit could not have been later. This is
the first week of our summer session, and instead of hundreds, thousands would
have joined in this reception. The scope of our work is high and broad. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
have the best lecturers we can secure to bring before us in a learned and sound
manner all that we should know in the domain of History, Literature, Art, Science,
Political Economy and the leading social questions. Last year 3,500 visited the
school during its session. Thirty-seven states were represented among its guests;
so you see, the school and its work are well known and appreciated throughout our
land. We combine here at Cliff Haven, the intellectual and the social in a high
degree, and the intellectual and social are both protected and permeated by a
religious spirit unobtrusive but all-pervading.</p>

<p>Whatever promotes the well-being and uplift of the citizens of this country, and
especially of this great Empire State over which you preside; whatever goes to
make an enlightened and safe people; whatever promotes, protects and preserves
the sound principles of the founders of our great Republic, must be dear to
your Excellency and deserve your inspiration. This we all feel to-day in your
presence here, in spite of your many laborious and pressing duties. While I invited
you, I feel that your presence to-day is due to the persuasive eloquence of one
of our trustees, Judge John B. Riley, who is also a member of the Champlain
Tercentenary Commission.</p>

<p>In the name of the trustees and patrons of the Catholic Summer School of
America I again welcome you to Cliff Haven. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>Appropriate response was made thereto by his Excellency, Gov. John
A. Dix.</p>

<p>The party was then driven to the Plattsburgh Barracks, where the
Fifth Infantry, U. S. A., on dress parade, under command of Col. Calvin
D. Cowles, was reviewed, and the cannon thundered forth salutes in
honor of the Governor and of Count de Peretti de la Rocca, of the
French Embassy at Washington. It was an imposing sight and a reminder
of the brilliant review of the same and other regiments and the
Canadian troops, on the same parade grounds, by President William H.
Taft, Ambassador Jusserand, Ambassador Bryce and Governors
Hughes and Prouty, July 7, 1909.</p>

</figure>

<p>Thereafter, a tour was made of the city, in which the party was
shown the graves of Captain George Downie and other British officers,
who had fallen in the battle of Plattsburgh. The Commissioners and
other guests were then formally received in the beautiful home of the
Hon. Smith M. Weed, on Cumberland avenue, which is situate near the
Champlain Memorial. Mr. and Mrs. George S. Weed assisted in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
reception of the distinguished guests. The guests were interested in seeing
in Mr. Weed’s library the noted painting of “The Battle of Lake
Champlain,” by Julian Oliver Davidson, a copy of which may be seen
in the original Report of this Commission.</p>

<p>At the close of the reception, the Commissioners and guests were given
a luncheon under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce, at the
Fouquet House, which stands on the site of the old Stage House occupied
by Major-Gen. Benjamin Mooers, of Revolutionary military fame, who
commanded the militia in the land engagement at the Battle of Plattsburgh.
Judge and Commissioner John B. Riley presided and extended
to the Commissioners and to the guests a hearty welcome. At the conclusion
of the luncheon, the Commissioners and their guests were escorted
by a platoon of mounted police, the entire Fifth Infantry, U. S. A., under
command of Col. Cowles and staff, through the principal streets, whose
buildings were beautifully decorated. Following the fifty automobiles
containing the party were the Guard of Honor of the Society of St. Jean
Baptiste, and the Horicon, Rescue and Lafayette Hose Companies.
They proceeded to the site of the Champlain Memorial statue, where
a platform for the speakers and guests had been erected, decorated with
white and blue and the fleur-de-lis of France. Seats had also been provided
for the general public.</p>

<h3 id="PartII_VI">VI. DEDICATORY CEREMONIES OF THE CHAMPLAIN
MEMORIAL STATUE AT PLATTSBURGH, N. Y., JULY 6, 1912</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The dedicatory ceremonies, over which Chairman H. Wallace
Knapp presided, were opened with music by the Fifth Infantry,
U. S. A. Band. The Invocation was pronounced by Rev. H. P.
LeF. Grabau, Rector of the Episcopal Church of Plattsburgh.</p>

<p>The Champlain memorial was then unveiled by Miss Katharine M.
Booth, daughter of Judge and Commissioner John H. Booth of Plattsburgh,
as “The Star Spangled Banner” was being played by the band.
As the Stars and Stripes were drawn from the statue and it was revealed
to view, a shout of applause broke forth from the enthusiastic assembly.
Then followed a salute fired by the Fifth Infantry of the U. S. A.</p>

<p>The Commissioners had the memorial draped with the historic
flag owned by Dr. George F. Kunz of New York City, President
of the Scenic and Historic Preservation Society of New York, which had
been offered for the occasion and accepted. That flag had flown
from the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris on July 4, 1900, when
the Lafayette statue by Paul Bartlett was presented by the school
children of America to the French nation. It was also used at the dedication
of Stony Point Park on the Hudson, and on the funeral train when
the remains of Governor Clinton were transferred from New York to
Kingston.</p>

<p>Senator H. Wallace Knapp, Chairman of the New York Lake
Champlain Tercentenary Commission, then delivered the following
address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Your Excellency, Governor Dix, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: We are assembled
on an historical spot that may properly lay claim to official recognition, for associations
connected with the progress of humanity in the Champlain Valley and this
vicinity are especially to be distinguished for the important events that are known to
have proceeded from the subject that we are here to recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>The battles of Valcour and Plattsburgh, and the maintenance here of a permanent
military post, are vitally connected with conditions attending the passing through
the lake of the first white man.</p>

<p>The patriotic spirit has never slumbered here. The sons of this county and
of the city of Plattsburgh who have dedicated their lives to the service of their
country, in the army and navy and in civic councils form a long roll of distinguished
honor. They have upheld the integrity of their country in every quarter
of the globe, and their deeds are glowing on the pages of history. And this public
service has been continuous since the first settlement here. This record has not
been interrupted. Here surely, then, our Memorial may be safely entrusted to fulfill
its purpose and we may leave it here, as in its long appointed home, telling to
the future, with voiceless eloquence, the meaning of the scene that appears before us.</p>

<p>For when we have gone away there will appear in the ensuing quiet a significance
here that can hardly be discerned through the sounds and the pageantry of the
present hour. Now we look upon the brave soldier, the intrepid sailor, the grand
discoverer, the wise administrator, the successful courtier, and the gallant friend of
kings. But when we are here alone and undistracted we shall recognize a deeper
and more abiding import. We shall recall his unfailing goodness of heart, his helpful
and untiring care for his associates, his generous mercy to the traitor, Vignan,
his motto that the saving of one soul was more worthy of endeavor than the conquest
of an empire. We shall know Champlain as the devoted lover of his fellow-man,
and in this philosophy we shall find the basic motive of his career, and indeed
I think it is for the charm of such qualities shining through virile manhood that we
most love to remember him. The Spanish conquerors were strong and venturesome,
but there is no gathering of many peoples to do honor to their memory; no songs
are sung for Cortez and Pizarro.</p>

<p>Our Monument will always be an inspiring influence for good and as time goes
on, piety and poesy and song will enrich the memory of our hero, and romance
will cast a halo around his deeds. It is perhaps from such beginnings that all the
great epics of the world have been developed, yet none of them, it is safe to say,
have proceeded from a nobler basis of character and action.</p>

<p>We are inaugurating our Memorial under happy conditions. A century of peace
between France, England, and America bespeaks a perpetuity of good will. Their
representatives have taken part in all the important functions of the Tercentenary
observances and they are here to-day with messages of cheer and friendship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At Crown Point on May 3d of this year, Mr. Hanotaux, who led the French
delegation entrusted with the presentation of the bust, “La France”, to the United
States, remarked in his address:</p>

<p>A French delegation has come to seal upon the base of this magnificent monument<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
an image of France. It expresses well what we have wished to say; it
will depict to you France, such as we Frenchmen conceive it, and as we love it. It
is France as she wishes to be and as she is.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not amiss to supplement this sentiment by pointing out that we have
chosen as the historic genius of our lake, not an American, nor an Englishman,
but a Frenchman, who represents to us France and the sons of France as we know
them and as we wish them to be. He was for us the crowning exemplar of ideal
chivalry, without fear and without reproach,—the first of many Frenchmen through
whom we owe so much to France. But such a character belongs to the world.
His representation here presides over the scenes of a great historic epoch that will
never be repeated. Our house is no longer divided: England and America will
never again contend upon the battlefield.</p>

<p>Samuel Champlain was called to his reward on Christmas day, the anniversary
of the Prince of Peace and Good Will throughout the world. That peace is now
assured us by the peoples who have gathered here, and as time goes on and the
agencies of human happiness increase within our border, the silent form above us
will tell His Master’s message with an eloquence that we in our day cannot hear
so well. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>I now take pleasure in presenting to you His Excellency, Gov. John
A. Dix.</p>

<p>Governor Dix spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Admiring to-day this beautiful statue of Champlain, this splendid embodiment of
genius and patriotism, it seems as if one were gazing upon it through the vista of a
beautiful parkway. The statue, in all its edifying beauty, is here before us, and
yet its influence and its meaning carry the mental eye adown three centuries of
visualization of civilizing events—sad and happy, depressing and gladdening, horrible
and glorious, all necessary in the foliage of the avenue of progress through
which the mind perceives and tries to understand the character of the man whom
we here honor.</p>

<p>Have you, in walking along the parkway of a city’s breathing-place or the
lane of an arbored village, at the end of your line of vision, come upon a solitary
figure—a monument, a great tree, the section of a home with a cupola upon it,
or whatever it may be that by its height and loneliness interrupt and end the vista?
Have you noticed that the width of the vista is seemingly greatest where you stand,
and gradually diminishes until at the finishing point it is narrow, very narrow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>As I view this product of man’s acknowledgment of his indebtedness to the past,
and of man’s ability to express for the present and for the ages to come his conception
of his obligation to heroes and pioneers, I seem to be looking from this
statue down the vista of a parkway of the three centuries between Champlain and us.</p>

<p>On either side stand sublime events of history, with the sun of Hope and Faith
shining above. Here and there trees shut off the sunshine, while others only serve
to beautify and embroider that sunshine as it filters through their verdant branches.
And all the while the roadway of civilization grows gradually from the narrowness
of the past to the breadth and the warmth of the present.</p>

<p>This is the picture as it presents itself to my mind, of the historic event we celebrate
and its true meaning.</p>

<p>We, of the more tolerant, more enlightened, and, I hope, happier world, of the
year 1912, see in this statue the heroic figure of the intrepid explorer, who was the
pioneer of civilization in this magnificent region of country. His was the narrower
world, perhaps, but to him belongs the immortal fame of beginning the gradual
broadening of the way which, through war and sacrifice, honor and glory, leads to
our present proud position among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>Since the plan of this Tercentenary celebration of Champlain’s discovery was so
well inaugurated and so well organized, tributes of the ablest orators, the greatest
writers, and the foremost officials of state and nation, have been paid to the character
and the achievements of Samuel Champlain. Words seem now almost superfluous,
for what can be said that will add to the fullness and the beauty and the
sincerity of the expressions of honor and appreciation which have been placed upon
the enduring records of time.</p>

<p>Champlain truly typifies the chivalry, the intrepidity and the charm of the people
of his time and country. The best tribute that has been paid to him, I think, was
that of Hamilton W. Mabie, and with Mr. Mabie’s words I will close: “A gentleman
by birth and training, calm in danger, resourceful and swift in action, strict
in discipline, but always just and kind.” (Applause.)</p>

</figure>

<p>Gov. John A. Mead of Vermont was officially represented by the
Adjutant-General of that State, Col. Lee S. Tillotson of St. Albans,
who was introduced and delivered the following address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen</em>: My position here
to-day reminds me of the story of the old colored gentleman who was being prosecuted
for the usual misdemeanor of stealing chickens. When his case was called,
the judge, who knew the culprit, looking down into the prisoner’s box where he was
seated, said: “Uncle Rastus, are you the respondent in this case?” “No, yo’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
honah,” said Uncle Rastus, “I’se not de respondent, I’se got a lawyer here who
is goin’ to do all de respondin’ fo’ me; I’se de ge’man who done stole de chickens.”
In this case, I am the respondent. The gentleman whom you invited and expected
to be present to-day has not stolen any chickens, but he is, unfortunately for you
and for him, detained at home by a slight attack of rheumatism, and when I tell
you that it was contracted while attending as a delegate the recent national Republican
convention at Chicago, you will not be surprised to learn that his malady is
inflammatory in its nature. But I want to tell you that Governor Mead is not
tying up his sore places with the red bandanna handkerchief. I don’t know how
you feel over here, but we in Vermont do not think that the facts and events
incident to the present presidential administration afford any man the right, constitutional
or otherwise, to charge President Taft with fraudulent practices. I know
that this is not the proper time nor place to talk politics, but, as you may have
guessed, I am a Republican, and we Republicans don’t have much incentive to
blow our political horns in Vermont, because everybody over there agrees with us,
and the inspiration of this opportunity in Governor Dix’s jurisdiction was too
strong to be resisted. However, I think we had better get on to a safer topic of
discussion. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>I suppose that on this occasion I ought to talk about history, but I don’t know
enough. I don’t even know whether the battle of Plattsburgh was a land engagement
or an aerial contest. The weather is usually a reasonably safe topic, but the
temperature here for the past few days has been so hot that it won’t admit of public
comment. So I have decided to talk about the scenery. I think I have made a
discovery. I have often wondered why it was that you New Yorkers were so
much more successful in attracting summer visitors to your territory than we in
Vermont. Since I have been over here I have discovered the reason. It is because
of the magnificent scenery afforded you on this side of the lake of the Green
Mountains of Vermont. You have been capitalizing our resources without our
permission. Now you must even things up, and I want to tell you that your
Adirondack Mountains appear to much better advantage, and are grander and more
magnificent from the viewpoint of the Vermont shore than from anywhere else.
If you don’t believe it, come over and see for yourselves. You will find in Vermont
just as warm a welcome, just as comfortable hotels, just as good roads, and just
as refreshing water,—and other things,—as anywhere else.</p>

<p>And now, Mr. Chairman, in closing, I wish to extend to you and the members
of your Commission, the Governor’s regrets, and mine, that he was not able to be
with you personally, and to thank you for the many courtesies which you have
shown to my friends and myself on this occasion. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Plattsburgh has many enterprising citizens and has had some liberal
benefactors. In the latter class, the name of the Hon. Francis Lynde
Stetson of New York City, a native of Clinton county and long-time
resident of Plattsburgh, will be cherished in grateful remembrance for
his many beneficent acts to that city. It was quite natural, therefore,
that he accept the Champlain memorial in behalf of the city of Plattsburgh,
which he did in the following touching address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Governor Dix</em>: Through the kind favor of the Mayor of the city of Plattsburgh
and in his behalf, I take pleasure in accepting from you this fine gift of the
State of New York, worthily set in this beautiful park provided by the liberality of
the people of Plattsburgh. The location is ideal, overlooking the most attractive
and the most famous bay of this lovely lake, which, unlike most North American
waters, bears the name of the discoverer, bestowed by himself. To those here
seeking for his monument, as in the case of Sir Christopher Wren, the answer
during three centuries might well have been, “look about you.” But now in the
fullness of time, the accumulating admiration of many generations has demanded
and has found concrete expression in this beautiful memorial of the character, the
constancy and the courage of Samuel Champlain, the Christian Explorer. This
work of man’s hands cannot enhance his fame, but it can and will indicate to
countless generations our capacity to appreciate his virtue.</p>

<p>To carry abroad the gospel of his Lord and Master; to extend the influence and
the prosperity of his beloved country; to replace savagery with orderly government
and religious civilization, he crossed the Atlantic twenty times; he traced its
western shore from Newfoundland to Cape Cod; he explored the Isthmus of Darien,
and proposed to join the two oceans; he pierced the Laurentian forests, and discovered
not only Champlain but also Nipissing and Huron; and he became the
founder of New France. For more than a score of years he ruled in justice and
equity, winning the hearts of his countrymen and the almost idolatrous affection of
the savage tribes of Canada. His integrity was spotless, his sincerity unquestioned;
and his piety was attested by his last will, devoting to religion his entire estate of
about $1,000.</p>

<p>That we should give ourselves for others, for community and for country is
supposed to be a call specially significant of the present hour. But three centuries
since it was heard and was followed by Samuel Champlain at the sacrifice of
much that most men deemed desirable. Luxurious ease at the royal court of
Henri IV. he despised, and through unbroken forests led the way for civilization,
thus answering the question of the Duke in “As You Like It”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent24">“Are not these woods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More free from peril than the envious court?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the deep fastnesses of the forests he carried the cross as his amulet and
sought the salvation of souls.</p>

<p>This day can show no higher type nor profess a nobler faith than his. This
poor French boy of Brouage by three-score years of faithful duty proved that virtue
is not the monopoly of any age or country or class; and that to help the world
greatly forward no special calling is necessary. All that is needed is the faithful
following of high ideals. Such was the accomplishment of Champlain and such,
two centuries later, of the other great hero of these waters, the chivalrous and God-fearing
Macdonough, soon to be honored by a monument on this shore.</p>

<p>It is well that this generation should make recognition of such lives, proving that
love toward God and man and its constant expression in a consistent life are not
incompatible with the development and exhibition of the most heroic and manly
virtues.</p>

<p>But to limit our recognition to the raising of a monument were indeed an empty
show. Those who without genuine and active sympathy would build the tombs of
the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous were denounced by the
Master as hypocrites.</p>

<p>Life service and not lip service is required of those who would perpetuate, and
should emulate the virtues of Champlain.</p>

<p>This monument is erected to him and not through the pretext of his name to
ourselves. But, in a sense it must imply a sympathetic appreciation by this generation
and this community. Let the deed follow the profession. Self-sacrifice, integrity,
devotion to duty, truth-telling, clean-living and love of God and man must
be the aim of every man, woman and child who in heart and truth helps raise this
monument. The aim I say, but, only by God’s help, the achievement, for to few
are given the enduring fortitude and the prevailing persistence of Champlain and
Macdonough.</p>

<p>That this monument shall stand and shall continue to stand a silent but effective
monitor, teaching the men, the women, the boys and the girls of this valley to lead
clean and helpful lives, and to leave behind them memories which shall encourage
others so to live, is the hope in which this gift is accepted and will be preserved.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>Ambassador J. J. Jusserand was unavoidably absent on a visit to the
Republic from which he is accredited to this country. He was represented,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
however, on this occasion by Count de Peretti de la Rocca,
Chargé d’Affaires de France, at Washington. Count de Peretti de la
Rocca was introduced and spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is often said that America looks always to the future. The beautiful festivities
at which we are assisting prove the contrary. Descendants of the pioneers of former
times on this continent, which they opened up to civilization, you are continuing
their work. Animated by their spirit of daring and activity, you are extending each
day the field of their conquests, and you are reaping the fruits of the harvest of
their deeds. But you like sometimes to stop your daily toil, to come and meditate
before the rude cradle of your great nation.</p>

<p>To-day, pleasure boats sail on this beautiful lake, and its shady banks seem to
have been intended always as a place of rest for tired city dwellers. It is not
without some effort of imagination that we can now recall the rugged Champlain
and his strange troop, sailing on the same lake in pursuit of the Iroquois. However,
you wished that the tourists, who come here each year in thousands, surrounded
by luxury and beauty, should be reminded of their first great predecessor. And
you have raised up to Champlain this monument, which does honor both to the
initiative of your Commissions and to the talents of your architects. You found that
there was in the life of Champlain, as in those of the other French pioneers, of whom
your historian, Parkman, so well wrote the lives, lessons which should not be lost.
The example of their ingenuity, which nothing could rebut, of their energy, which
nothing could daunt, of their faith, which never was discouraged, is still a lesson of
confidence and optimism. Pessimistic persons might perhaps point out that these
men failed to attain their ends. They traveled over this continent seeking a way
to China, and that way did not exist. Anyway, they hoped that the countries which
they discovered would become the possessions of their nation and of their King,
and now the lilies of the French monarchy have been replaced by the Stars and
Stripes of the American democracy. But these are only partial failures and
their efforts were not in vain. China remained closed to them, but America and its
treasures were opened to them. The vicissitudes of events have caused a change
of nationality in the countries discovered by them, but I am sure they are content
in their graves on account of celebrations of their memory such as that of to-day:
on account also of the unalterable friendship which binds your nation to theirs and
especially on account of the confident eagerness with which, inherited from them,
you continue and complete their work.</p>

<p>Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you permit me I will add some words in my own
language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p lang="fr">Cela ne sera pas pour déplaire à mon grande compatriote Champlain.
Je tiens à exprimer au Gouverneur Dix at au Chairman Knapp tous mes remerciements
pour la manière si flatteuse at si affectueuse dont ils ont parlé de mon pays.
Je veux vous dire à tous combien je suis heureux et reconnaissant que le souvenir
de la France ait été si intimement associé à ces belles cérémonies.</p>

<p lang="fr">Enfin j’ajouterai combien j’ai été touché par l’aimable accueil que nous a réservé
la cité de Plattsburgh dont la beauté des paysages, le pittoresque des rues et des
maisons, le charme des habitants m’ont tout spécialement frappé. Aussi est-ce du
fond de coeur que je forme les voeux les plus ardents pour la continuation de sa
prospérité.</p>
</div>

<p>The address was enthusiastically received.</p>

<p>The Hon. John A. Stewart of New York was the next speaker and
in the course of his address, which was extempore and therefore unreported
except in substance, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From Champlain’s day we have grown into the most potential nation in the
world, but let us thank God that mere power is not the measure of a nation’s
greatness. We have become the richest nation in the world, but every day of our
existence we should give thanks to the Almighty that our standing among the nations
rests upon another basis than the mere possession of great wealth. We are the
most populous among the nations of advanced civilization, but we should thank
God that the gauge of our power and our greatness does not lie merely in
superiority in point of numbers. A nation like the individual is great only to the
degree of the possession of the homely virtues, the virtues of the home and fireside,
of contentment and the peace and satisfaction which come from honest toil, from
the day’s tasks done in the proper spirit of thankfulness for all the blessings which
have come from advantages given by a prodigal nature. The prophetic vision of
Champlain which saw occupying the North American continent a great and a
mighty people has been realized. It is to men of Champlain’s blood that we owe
the searching out and the discovery of the fertility of this great land and its adaptation
for the uses of mankind. To those of his own race, who have succeeded him,
we Americans are tied by the bond of a common destiny. Though separated
politically, Canada, which is the heritage of Champlain, and this beautiful north
country which is equally his heritage and one of the most beautiful parts of the
great Republic, stand shoulder to shoulder in the working out of a common fate;
for no danger can menace the one without the other sharing in that danger and no
great national blessing can come to the one without that same blessing working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
its benefit to the other. Blessed is the land and blessed the people where the
homely virtues are still inculcated, where that admonition of the Almighty is
regarded not merely as an article of faith, but as a precept to be followed, “Honor
thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee,” for of such is the land which Champlain found and the
people which bless him as the great discoverer. (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>The last speaker was the Hon. Job E. Hedges of New York City,
whose address sparkled with wit and kept the audience in a ripple of
laughter. It was also extempore. In the course of his address he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The specific things Champlain did are not so important as his motive. He was
an epoch in history. It falls to few men to be greater than their generation. If
we are to draw a lesson at this time, it is that physical courage unbacked by moral
effort is futile. It is very easy to be good rhetorically. I believe in the efficacy of
prayer, but it is possible to remain on your knees so long that you overlook a
neighbor’s distress.</p>

<p>It is better to try and fail than not to endeavor. Champlain never felt that he
was called—he just went. He never worried about prosperity. He framed his
opinions without asking himself whether he was in the majority or not. It is better
to practice one commandment and forget the other nine than have all of them committed
to memory as a rhetorical exercise.</p>

<p>It is a great thing to have a man’s memory remain 300 years without tarnish—or
even 300 days without it. It is a wonderful thing to be great and not know it.
Champlain could have closed his eyes forever at the end of any twenty-four hours
of his life and have said, “I have done the best I could.” (Applause.)</p>
</div>

<p>Benediction was then pronounced by the Rt. Rev. Monsignor M. J.
Lavelle, Vicar General of New York, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Father of Bounty from Whom all blessings flow, we thank Thee from the inmost
recesses of our souls for the blessings bestowed upon our country and the human
race, through the courage and self-sacrifice of Samuel Champlain. This monument
dedicated to his memory to-day, is a token, primarily, of our gratitude to
Thee for the favors Thou hast granted us through Thy servant. Teach us all
to be like him, intrepid in danger, indomitable in trial, undismayed in failure and
unspoiled in success. May everyone who has participated in the erection and
dedication of this monument have the grace to direct his own life in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
happiness and virtue, and also to be a source of benediction unto generations yet
unborn.</p>

<p>We pray Thee, O Father of Might, Wisdom and Justice, through Whom alone
authority is rightfully administered, laws enacted and judgment decreed, assist
with Thy Holy Spirit of Counsel and Fortitude, the President of these United
States, that his administration may be eminently useful to Thy people over whom
he presides, by the encouragement of virtue and religion, by wise enforcement
of the laws in justice and in mercy, and by repressing vice and immorality. Let
the Light of Thy Divine Wisdom shine upon the deliberations of Congress, and
manifest itself in all the laws framed for our government, that these regulations
may tend to the preservation of peace, the extension of National prosperity, the
increase of industry, sobriety and useful knowledge, and may perpetuate amongst
us the boon of equal liberty.</p>

<p>We pray also for the Governors of these two states, for the members of the
Legislatures, for all judges and magistrates and other officials appointed to guard
our political welfare. Aid them with Thy guiding hand, that they may be able
to discharge the duties of their several offices with honesty and ability.</p>

<p>We pray also for all our brethren and fellow-citizens throughout the United
States, that they may be blessed in the knowledge, and sanctified in the performance
of Thy Holy Will. Preserve us in unity, and in that peace which the
world cannot give. And after having tasted Thy bounty here below, may we be
admitted to the joys that are eternal.</p>

<h3 id="PartIII_I">I. FEDERAL CO-OPERATION AND ASSISTANCE RENDERED
BY SENATORS OF THE UNITED STATES,
REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">This record would be incomplete without reference to the active
co-operation of the Government of the United States in authorizing
formal invitations to be extended through the Department of
State to the Republic of France and the Kingdom of Great Britain including
the Dominion of Canada to be officially represented at the Tercentenary
Celebration and in making ample appropriation for the entertainment
of the foreign guests and of the President, Vice-President and
other officials of the United States; and without formal acknowledgment
in appreciation of the activities and assistance rendered by Vice-President
James S. Sherman, whose grandfather was a navigator of Lake Champlain,
and by the Senators of New York and Vermont and other states in
the Senate of the United States and by the Representatives from those
states in Congress. The New York and Vermont members of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs, namely, Hon. James Breck Perkins, a writer
on French history; Hon. David J. Foster, Hon. Jacob Sloat Fassett and
Hon. Francis Burton Harrison, all forceful and influential Representatives,
assisted by Hon. John J. Fitzgerald, Hon. Edward B. Vreeland,
Hon. George R. Malby, Hon. James S. Sherman, Hon. Michael E.
Driscoll, Hon. John W. Dwight, Hon. William H. Draper, Hon.
George N. Southwick, Hon. William Sulzer, Hon. William S. Bennet,
Hon. Jacob Van Vechten Olcott, Hon. Peter A. Porter, Hon. De Alva
S. Alexander, and other Representatives of New York, and Hon. Kittredge
Haskins of Vermont, were zealous in their support of the project
from its inception. On February 16, 1909, Representative Foster of
Vermont from the Committee on Foreign Affairs reported the following
Joint Resolution favorably to the House, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Joint resolution (H. J. Res. 257) to authorize the Secretary of State to invite
the Governments of France and Great Britain to participate in the proposed
tercentenary celebration of the discovery of Lake Champlain by Samuel de
Champlain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The States of New York and Vermont, by legislation and appropriation,
have authorized the celebration of the three hundredth anniversary of the
discovery of Lake Champlain by Samuel de Champlain; and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The date of the said celebration has been fixed for the first week in
July, 1909; Therefore be it</p>

<p><em>Resolved, etc.</em>, That the Secretary of State be, and he is hereby, authorized and
requested to extend to the Governments of France and Great Britain an invitation
to be present at and to participate in the proposed celebration during the first
week of July, 1909, to commemorate the three hundredth anniversary of the discovery
of Lake Champlain by Samuel de Champlain.</p>
</div>

<p>When said resolution was reached on the House Calendar on
February 17th, Mr. Foster said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is very little to be said by the way of explanation of this
resolution. A very full report accompanies it explaining fully the significance of
the proposed celebration. As indicated in the preamble, both the States of New
York and Vermont have appropriated money for this celebration, which will occur
during the first week of next July. While these two states have taken the initiative,
the occasion will be one of national significance. We are already assured that
the President of the United States will be present and participate in the exercises.
And the occasion will be one of international importance. For this reason it is
desired that authority be given the State Department to extend an invitation to
the two nations most intimately associated with the United States in the historic event
which this celebration will commemorate. It was a son of France who discovered
the beautiful body of water that bears his name. Canada, that loyal dominion
of Great Britain, borders upon the lake. It is peculiarly desirable, therefore, that
an invitation be extended to the Governments of France and Great Britain to
participate in the celebration.</p>
</div>

<p>The Joint Resolution after a brief discussion was thereupon unanimously
passed.</p>

<p>The Report of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs was printed
in full in the Congressional Record of March 3, 1909, in the form in
which it was adopted and appears in the <a href="#App_I">Appendix</a> of this Report. (See<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Congressional Record 60th Congress, Second Session, pp. 2531, 2582
and 3770.)</p>

<p>Speaker Joseph G. Cannon, Representative James A. Tawney of
Minnesota, Chairman of Committee on Appropriations and other members
of the House from states not in direct touch with the undertaking
gave it their support.</p>

<p>The Joint Resolution was favorably reported through Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge from the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate
on February 24, 1909, and on motion of Senator Chauncey M. Depew
it was passed. (See Congressional Record 60th Congress, Second Session,
p. 2987.)</p>

<p>Senator Thomas C. Platt of New York and Senators William P.
Dillingham and Carroll S. Page of Vermont also gave this and other
matters pertaining to the celebration such consideration as was necessary
to ensure Federal co-operation. The Joint Resolution was approved by
President Roosevelt on March 2, 1909. (See Congressional Record
60th Congress Second Session, p. 3666.)</p>

<p>In this connection it will be remembered that Senator Redfield Proctor
of Vermont and the Honorable Elihu Root, while Secretary of State
had presented the matter at a late day in a prior session of Congress
and had in a measure prepared the way for favorable action in 1909.
Senator Proctor took deep interest in the project, but to the great regret
of his many friends he did not live to see it carried to completion. His
death occurred in Washington, D. C., March 4, 1908.</p>

<p>His son, the Honorable Fletcher D. Proctor, while Governor of
Vermont in 1906, had approved the original Concurrent Resolution, introduced
in the House of Representatives of Vermont in November of
that year by Hon. Robert W. McCuen of Vergennes, providing for the
appointment of a Commission to confer with several Commissions to be
appointed in New York and in Canada to arrange for a celebration
of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Discovery of Lake
Champlain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>From that time on Senator Redfield Proctor and Governor Fletcher
D. Proctor of Vermont gave the matter their official and strong personal
support as long as they lived.</p>

<p>Congressmen George R. Malby and David J. Foster were untiring
in their efforts to insure Federal co-operation, as was Honorable Elihu
Root, both as Secretary of State and as United States Senator, whose
masterly address at Plattsburgh on July 7, 1909, is a contribution to the
history of the Iroquois Confederacy.</p>

<p>The untimely deaths of Governor Fletcher D. Proctor, of Congressmen
David J. Foster and George R. Malby before the Champlain memorials
were dedicated and the work of the Commissions completed, to
whose success they had all materially contributed, were deeply deplored.
The loss of Professor Walter E. Howard of the Vermont Commission
and of Assemblyman Alonson T. Dominy of New York Commission,
both of whom were desirous of co-operation in the work of their respective
Commissions, was keenly felt by their colleagues.</p>

<p>Senators John Raines and Thomas F. Grady of New York, who
were majority and minority leaders of the Senate when the project
was given legislative sanction, did not live to see the Champlain memorials
constructed. Senator Patrick H. McCarren of Brooklyn, who assisted
in interesting the Representatives in Congress from the City of New York
in the celebration, did not live to participate in it himself.</p>

<p>All these friends of the project in its initial and later stages will be
remembered for their interest in this historical commemorative celebration,
the results of which have been felt in both hemispheres in strengthening
the amicable relations existing between the three great nations participating
in the international festivities. Its scope in a measure was outlined
in the presentation of the matter to the Legislative Committees,
making the original and second appropriation, over which Senators William
W. Armstrong and Jotham P. Allds in the Senate and Hon. Edwin
A. Merritt, Jr., in the Assembly, presided.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3 id="PartIII_II">II. BRIEF REVIEW OF THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION
AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN APPRECIATION
OF THE ASSISTANCE RENDERED BY THE
REPRESENTATIVES OF FOREIGN NATIONS, MILITARY
ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS.</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">An outline of the work of the Commission was embodied in the
recommendations adopted at the conclusion of the investigation
and deliberation of the Preliminary Commission, found at pages
21 to 40 of the First Report of this Commission. Some modifications in
the original plan were found necessary as the preparation for the celebration
took definite form, but in the main there was substantial adherence to
the original recommendations of the Preliminary Commission as may be
seen from an examination of the Tercentenary Exercises and the transactions
of the Commission hereinbefore given in some detail which involved,
in addition to the celebration, the construction of two memorials
to Samuel Champlain in the Champlain valley. One of these was a
joint memorial constructed by the Vermont and New York Commissions
in co-operation from funds jointly contributed by the two Commissions.
That is the Champlain memorial at Crown Point Forts. Without the
friendly assistance and co-operation of the Vermont Tercentenary Commission
in planning and in sharing the expense involved in the construction
of the Crown Point memorial, it is not likely that two memorials
would have been built. This Commission takes this occasion to make
permanent record of the fact that the members of the Vermont Commission
were quite as desirous of erecting a fitting memorial to Samuel Champlain
as were the members of the New York Commission, notwithstanding
the fact that it was apparent to them that the joint memorial was likely
to be located within the confines of the State of New York, rather than
in Vermont. Undoubtedly the character of the memorial in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
a lighthouse and its location on a point projecting far into the waters of
the lake where it may be seen quite as readily by the citizens of Vermont
as by those of New York, had something to do in bringing about
unanimity of sentiment in the action of the two Commissions in deciding
to erect a joint memorial.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this memorial will stand for all time as a monument to
the wisdom of the two Commissions in thus performing a public duty in
the spirit of fairness to the people of both states and in grateful appreciation
of the character and services to humanity of Samuel Champlain.
It met with the hearty approval of the French delegation, who placed on
it the Rodin bust, a work of art, selected by M. Hanotaux and others
and purchased with funds contributed by His Excellency, Clément
Armand Fallières, President of the Republic of France, M. Raymond
Poincaré, President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs,
recently elected President of the Republic of France and many others,
as the seal of the Republic of France. They spoke in commendation of
its artistic proportions and of its unique symbolism of the diffusion of the
light of civilization through the valley by Champlain and his followers,
who sought to inculcate in the “untutored minds” of the savages in the
region the humane principles and benign precepts of the Christian
religion.</p>

<p>The Champlain Memorial Statue at Plattsburgh was erected by the
New York Commission out of the funds appropriated solely by the Legislature
of New York. It occupies a commanding position at the outlet
of the Saranac river overlooking the lake. The bronze statue of Champlain,
the crouching Indian at its base and the granite approach together
constitute an unique memorial, artistic in outline and worthy the discoverer
of the lake, which bears his name. This will stand comparison
with any memorial of the kind in the country.</p>

<p>The Commission submits these two memorials to the considerate judgment
of the people of the State in the confidence that they will meet
with general approval.</p>

<p>The Commission has thus constructed two suitable permanent memorials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
to Samuel Champlain in the valley as it was authorized to do
by Chapter 181 of the Laws of 1911. In this as in other matters the
Commission has endeavored to carry out the spirit as well as the letter
of the acts under which it performed its labors.</p>

<p>In addition to the building of the Champlain memorials, the Celebration
with its varied literary, military and naval features was carried to a
successful conclusion by the Lake Champlain Tercentenary Commissions
of New York and Vermont with the co-operation of the Government
of the United States and the attendance of the official representatives
of France, Great Britain and Canada. The Dominion of Canada
sent over the Governor-General’s Foot-Guards under Lieut. Colonel
D. R. Street with twenty-two officers and three hundred and eleven
enlisted men and also the Fifth Royal Canadian Highlanders under
Lt. Colonel George S. Cantlie with twenty-eight officers and four
hundred and thirty-eight men.</p>

<p>The participation of the Canadian troops in their brilliant uniforms in
the Plattsburgh and Burlington parades on July 7 and 8, 1909, gave
color to the marching columns and elicited the commendation of President
Taft as well as of the French and British Ambassadors. It was a graceful
compliment on the part of the Canadian Government to the people of
the United States and gratefully appreciated by members of the Commission
and others interested in the success of the celebration, to which
this contributed not a little.</p>

<p>The presence of the French Ambassador, His Excellency, J. J.
Jusserand, the British Ambassador, the Right Honorable James Bryce,
the Postmaster-General of the Dominion of Canada, the Honorable
Rodolphe Lemieux, the Premier of the Province of Quebec, Sir Lomer
Gouin, the Lieut.-Governor of the Province of Quebec, Sir Adolphe
Pelletier, the Vice-Admiral of the Japanese Navy, Baron Stakichi Uriu
and others officially representing their respective Governments, gave it
international significance, and the history of Lake Champlain in this and
other ways has become a matter of interest to the people of other lands.</p>

<p>The participation of these distinguished representatives of France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Great Britain, Canada and Japan in the Tercentenary Exercises added
dignity and stateliness to the public and social functions of the celebration,
which was widely commended through the press of this and other
countries and has since become known as one of the <ins class="corr" id="tn-188" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'principal commorative'">
principal commemorative</ins> celebrations of the century.</p>

<p>The discriminating and brilliant addresses of the French Ambassador,
well known as the author of “The Literary History of The English
People” and of many other works, as well as for his celebrity as a great
diplomat, were keenly appreciated and will be read by all interested in
the tragic <ins class="corr" id="tn-188a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'events occuring'">
events occurring</ins> in the Champlain valley during the period of
its French occupancy. His touching tribute to Marquis de Montcalm,
his graceful expressions of the warmth of the friendship existing between
the people of France and those of America and his profound appreciation
of the generous impulses of the people of New York and Vermont
in projecting and carrying to a successful conclusion this commemorative
celebration, in which Samuel Champlain was the central figure, will long
be remembered. His long residence at Washington as the Ambassador
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of France,
his deep interest in American institutions and in American history, and
his wide and favorable acquaintance with the people of this country
have ingratiated him in their affections, until they have become accustomed
to look upon the distinguished French Ambassador as a member
of the official circle of the nation.</p>

<p>The profound and illuminating addresses of the Rt. Hon. James
Bryce, the British Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary,
delivered by him at Ticonderoga, Plattsburgh and Burlington,
were full of that ripe scholarship found in all his public papers and in
such works as his “Holy Roman Empire,” “The American Commonwealth,”
“Studies in History and Jurisprudence” and in his other
treatises. They were overflowing with good will toward the people of
this country who consider Ambassador Bryce as a staunch friend of
American institutions, as evidenced in “The American Commonwealth”
and in all his public addresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>Rarely, if ever, have there been accredited to this country by foreign
nations two Ambassadors at the same time possessing such rare literary
and diplomatic qualities as Ambassadors Jusserand and Bryce, each of
whom achieved distinction and has been honored in his own country.</p>

<p>The able and instructive addresses of Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux, Postmaster-General
of Canada and Sir Lomer Gouin, Premier of the Province
of Quebec, at Plattsburgh and Burlington were replete with
historical suggestions touching the Champlain, St. Lawrence River and
Great Lake regions and conveyed to the people south of the international
boundary the good will of the people of Canada and their gratitude
at the efforts being put forth to commemorate the life, the character and
achievements of Samuel Champlain, who founded Quebec, the oldest city
in the Dominion. There breathed through these the spirit of good will
and genuine appreciation for what was being done in this celebration.
The Canadian visitors created a most favorable impression and on their
departure left many warm friends behind.</p>

<p>By a fortunate coincidence, Vice-Admiral of the Japanese Navy, Baron
Stakichi Uriu, was visiting this country during the period of the Tercentenary
Celebration and was one of the invited guests of the New York
Commission. He spoke briefly at Ticonderoga and since his return to
Japan has conveyed to the Commission his appreciation of the honor conferred
upon him in being permitted to witness the Tercentenary Celebration
and at receiving the official Report containing a record of it.</p>

<p>The addresses of these representatives of Foreign Governments were
entertaining and valuable contributions to the Tercentenary Exercises,
giving them an international character exponential of events to be commemorated
in tracing the history of the discovery of the lake and the
subsequent control of the territory by three successful sovereign nations.</p>

<p>The Commission takes this occasion to acknowledge its obligations in
this respect to the distinguished visitors and Foreign Governments, which
they severally represented, for their assistance and co-operation in giving
the Tercentenary Celebration its international character and some of its
most charming features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>We cannot close this report without again expressing our grateful
appreciation to the people of France for their thoughtfulness and generosity
in sending to this country a work of art by one of their most distinguished
sculptors, to embellish the Memorial Lighthouse erected by the
States of New York and Vermont to commemorate the life of Samuel
Champlain. It was a delicate and beautiful expression of appreciation
on the part of the leaders of thought and culture in our sister Republic
across the sea to present a bust of such symbolism as “La France” as
the seal of their approval of our efforts in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as we have been able to do so, we have preserved in this report
the addresses of M. Hanotaux and others, as well as some of their reports
on their return to Paris, embodying their views and expressing their feelings
toward the people of this nation, which throw new light on the
sympathetic character and generous impulses of the French people. The
coming of a delegation of so many distinguished Frenchmen was a great
compliment to the people of this nation. This in itself was a testimonial
of good will, appreciated fully as keenly as the work of art. The people
of the Champlain valley and elsewhere will not be likely to forget the
fact that in addition to the distinguished line of great Frenchmen from
Champlain to Ambassador Jusserand, who have visited the Champlain
valley, there came to that valley in the month of May, 1912, a delegation
of the most distinguished Frenchmen representing industry, commerce,
science, literature and art, as well as civil and military affairs,
jurisprudence, statesmanship and diplomacy, that ever visited this
country. They came to place the seal of France upon the Crown Point
Memorial Lighthouse to Samuel Champlain, and to convey to the people
of this country the appreciation of the French Nation for what was being
done to commemorate the life and character of one of their countrymen.
The names of this delegation have already appeared, but let record be
herein made of the fact that Fernand Cormon, member of the Institute
and President of the Academy of Fine Arts, was one of the delegation
that brought the Rodin allegorical bust from France and directed its
location on the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>The President of the United States, William Howard Taft, Governor
Charles E. Hughes, Governor George H. Prouty, Secretary of War
Jacob M. Dickinson, Senator Elihu Root, Congressmen George R.
Malby, David J. Foster, Frank Plumley and the other speakers, the
poets and the clergymen who participated in the Celebration as well as
Governor John A. Dix of New York and Governor John A. Mead of
Vermont and other speakers and clergymen, who took part in the dedication
of the two Champlain memorials, not only put the members of the
two Champlain Commissions, but the people of the Champlain valley
under obligations to them for their contributions to the excellence and
high quality of the literary exercises.</p>

referred to and the Flotilla, comprising the torpedo boat <i>Manley</i> and
two steam cutters named <i>Plattsburgh</i> and <i>Burlington</i>, respectively, under
command of Lieut. G. W. Steele, Jr., with Midshipman Gerard Bradford
second in command, and L. O. Armstrong, with his company of 150
Indians, <ins class="corr" id="tn-191" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'descendents of the tribes'">
descendants of the tribes</ins> originally occupying the Champlain
valley, were important factors in the military, naval and pageant features
of the Tercentenary Celebration contributing materially to its success.
The maneuvering of these troops in the Champlain valley was suggestive
of the military expeditions and fierce engagements that characterized its
history for nearly two hundred years after the discovery of the lake by
Samuel Champlain.</p>

<p>This Commission takes this occasion to acknowledge its obligations
in this direction to the commissioned and other officers and members of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
these various military organizations as well as to the Brigadier-General,
Major-General and other officers and members of the National Guard
of New York, who took part in the celebration and in the dedicatory
ceremonies of the two memorials in July, 1912.</p>

<p>The Commission is also grateful to Hon. Robert Bacon, former
Ambassador to France, to Paul Fuller, Jr., Secretary of Franco-American
Committee, to Hon. Frank S. Witherbee, President and to
the members of the Lake Champlain Association, to President John H.
Finley of the College of the City of New York, to Hon. McDougall
Hawkes, Chairman of the American Board of the French Institute in
the United States, to Hon. Charles B. Alexander, to former Senator
William A. Clark of New York, to Hon. A. Barton Hepburn, President
of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York and to
all others, who assisted in the entertainment of the French Delegation
on their visit to this country in April-May, 1912.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is also made of the entertainment of the members
of the Preliminary Champlain Commission by the Hon. and Mrs. Nelson
W. Fisk at their home at Isle La Motte on September 7, 1907, and of
the transportation of the members of that Commission on the <i>Valcour</i>,
owned by Hon. Joseph C. Sibley, to Burlington in the afternoon of that
day, where they were entertained by the Ethan Allen Club in the
evening. Representative Sibley also placed his yacht, <i>Valcour</i>, at the
disposition of the Commission during the week of the Celebration.</p>

<p>It will also be remembered that Mr. and Mrs. Stephen H. P. Pell
entertained President Taft and other distinguished guests at their home
at Ticonderoga on July 6, 1909, and also the French delegation on
May 3, 1912.</p>

<p>Commissioner and Mrs. Walter C. Witherbee entertained members of
the Commission at their beautiful home at Port Henry on July 5, 1909.</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Col. Robert M. Thompson, accommodations
were provided by him for entertainment of members of the Commission at
Ticonderoga on July 5 and 6, 1909.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Commissioner Howland Pell entertained the members of the Commission
at his reconstructed Germain Redoubt at Ticonderoga on May
3, 1909.</p>

<p>Hon. John R. Myers of Rouse’s Point supervised the transportation of
the participants in the Indian pageants during the celebration and in other
ways aided the Commission in its labors.</p>

<p>Frank H. Severance, secretary of the Buffalo Historical Society, was
secretary of the Preliminary Lake Champlain Commission and prepared
two historical papers, which appeared in the First Report of this Commission.
In these respects and otherwise he rendered important services to
this Commission.</p>

<p>The Notes on the Archæology of the Champlain valley, contained in
the <a href="#App_IV">Appendix</a> of this volume, by Prof. George H. Perkins, Ph.D., state
geologist of Vermont, is a valuable contribution to this Report and is
gratefully appreciated by the members of this Commission.</p>

<p>The typographical excellence of the First Report of this Commission
elicited general commendation and the State Printers, J. B. Lyon Company
of Albany, New York, have spared no pains in the presswork of this
Final Report to insure its general excellence.</p>

<p>The exhaustive analytical Index to the First Report and also that to the
Final Report, prepared by Charles Alexander Nelson, A. M., will
greatly facilitate their usefulness for historical and other purposes.</p>

<p>The members of the Commission were among the invited guests of the
Hudson-Fulton Commission during that memorable celebration.</p>

<p>All these were gratefully appreciated as well as all other things done and
courtesies shown to the Commission by the people of the Champlain valley
in their enthusiastic support of the project of suitably celebrating the discovery
of the lake.</p>

<p>In concluding their work, the Commissioners take this occasion to express
their appreciation of the generous support and wide publicity given
to the Tercentenary project by the Press of this Country and of Canada,
which contributed much to the popular interest shown in this commemorative
celebration.</p>

<h3 id="PartIII_III">III. HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TERCENTENARY CELEBRATION</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">If the Tercentenary Celebration has awakened a deeper popular
interest in the history of the Champlain valley, and as a result of
that a broader and more profound appreciation of the principles of
civil and religious liberty underlying our American institutions, and of
the heroic sacrifices made by the founders of this government to insure
its perpetuity, then the members of the Commission and the people of
the state may feel well repaid for all efforts put forth in its prosecution.</p>

<p>In the various papers and addresses of the celebration frequent allusion
was made to the important events occurring in the several epochs
of the history of Lake Champlain, and many of these were elaborated
upon at some length. It was not possible, however, to do more.</p>

<p>The critical history of the Champlain valley is yet to be written. For
three centuries it has been the arena wherein have occurred many crucial
events affecting the evolution and the character of American institutions.</p>

<p>Ira Allen in his “Natural and Political History of the State of Vermont,”
Francis Parkman in his various historical works, Hon. Lucius E.
Chittenden in his addresses and public papers, Peter S. Palmer in his
“History of Lake Champlain,” and in his “History of the Battle of
Valcour on Lake Champlain,” Winslow C. Watson in his “History of
Essex County,” his “Pioneer History of the Champlain Valley” and
his “Men and Times of the Revolution,” Thomas Hawley Canfield in
his “Discovery, Navigation and Navigators of Lake Champlain,”
Zadock Thompson in his histories of the State of Vermont and in his
“Northern Guide,” Hiland Hall in his “History of Vermont,”
Winslow C. Watson in his “Military and Political History of Essex
County,” [N. Y.] in the “History of Essex County,” [N. Y.] by
H. P. Smith, in the papers entitled “The First Battle of Lake Champlain,”
by George F. Bixby, Rev. Joseph Cook in his “Historical
Address at the Centennial Anniversary of the Settlement of Ticonderoga,”
and in other addresses and writings, Walter H. Crockett in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
his “History of Lake Champlain,” and others, have given much of the
history of the successive periods, although the works of some of these
are necessarily too limited to include a complete history of the region in
all its amplitude and in all its details.</p>

<p>In the papers and proceedings of the Vermont Historical Society, as
well as in the “Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State
of New York” and the “Documentary History of the State of New
York,” and in other transcripts of documents in foreign and American
archives, and in the Military Records of the United States, France, Great
Britain and Canada may be found much material relating to the history
of Lake Champlain. There will be found in such libraries as the State
Library at Albany, the State Library at Montpelier, the library of the
Ticonderoga Historical Society, the libraries at Port Henry and at
Plattsburgh, as well as in the library at Middlebury College and in the
library of the University of Vermont, at Burlington, Vt., in the Collections
of the New York State Historical Association, the New York, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and other State Historical Societies,
and in the libraries of Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec, maps, charts, documents
and other material relating to the region. The foreign material is
confined principally to events occurring prior to 1783, except such British
and Canadian documents as relate to the War of 1812.</p>

<p>The correspondence between the Colonial Governors and military and
naval officers in America, including General Jeffrey Amherst and General
John Burgoyne, with William Pitt and other representatives of the
home government, throws much light on the events of the British period
from 1758 to 1783. Other historical writings and standard histories
may also be consulted with profit.</p>

<p>Since the conclusion of the War of 1812 the history of the Champlain
valley has been that of a record of the settlement, the agricultural
and mineral development of the territory bordering on the lake, and of
an active transportation and commercial business done on the lake until
the construction of railroads paralleling it on either side, which checked
the volume of transportation by water as well as the active passenger
service that had been done by steamers for three-quarters of a century.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
The completion of the barge canal between the Hudson and Lake
Champlain may to some extent restore the volume of transportation on
the lake.</p>

<p>From pre-historic times the Champlain valley has been one of the
thoroughfares of successive nations occupying the region, inviting alike to
discoverer, trader, pioneer, warrior and traveler. It was but natural that
its circumjacent shores and beautiful islands should become the homes
of sturdy men, breathing the ozone of the mountain air wafted down into
the valley, and possessing an independence and resolution found in such
men as the Allens, the Warrens, the Bakers, and the Chittendens. It
was this spirit which moved Ira Allen to incorporate in the first constitution
of Vermont, adopted July 2 to 8, 1777, a mandatory provision providing
for a common school in each town, a grammar school in each
county, and a university in the state, and afterward he gave all his
property to found the University of Vermont.</p>

<p>The conditions obtaining in the Champlain valley during the Tercentenary
Celebration were thus picturesquely but aptly described by Dr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie, the Tercentenary orator at Ticonderoga, in the
Outlook of July 31, 1909:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>* * * Never were conditions more favorable for such a celebration as
that planned in honor of Champlain’s discovery. Barring one day, the weather
was perfect. Refreshing breezes swept through the gaps between the soft blue
domes on either side of the lake, tempering the ardor of the sun’s rays, while the
air was of that crystalline clarity, which exhilarates and draws from man involuntary
exclamations of gladness for the fact of mere existence. Each day a pageant of
great, snowy clouds swept across the deep blue sky, adding to the dreamy charm
of the background of the celebration. The spectator’s manipulation of the pigments
of language is not so perfect as was Turner’s of paints; but he wishes it were, in
order that he might convey an impression of the changing lights and shadows and
tints, which presented new combinations of color with every passing moment. From
the moment the rays of the rising sun shot through the notches in the Green
Mountains, informing the visitor that he or she must be up and doing if the event
of the day was to be witnessed, until the golden afterglow had ceased to define the
rounded heights of the Adirondacks and the amethystine tints of the mountain sides
had deepened into the black shadow of night, each hour had a fresh temptation
for the artist.</p>

in that invigorating atmosphere. Among such was Henry J. Raymond,
who took his course at the University of Vermont, and became founder
of the New York <cite>Times</cite> and representative in Congress during the

<p>In the Congressional representation of the Champlain valley occur the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
names of many distinguished citizens: Peter Sailly of Plattsburgh, representative
in Congress in 1804, who enjoyed the confidence of President

<p>Honorable Azariah C. Flagg of Plattsburgh was Secretary of State
in 1826, and State Comptroller in 1834, and Hon. John F. O’Brien
of Plattsburgh was Secretary of State from 1903 to 1907.</p>

<p>Hon. St. John B. L. Skinner of Clinton County was Postmaster-General
under Andrew Johnson.</p>

<p>Among the early settlers, who located in Plattsburgh, were Judge
Zephaniah Platt, formerly of Poughkeepsie, member of the first Provincial
Congress of New York and a member of the Convention called to
consider the Federal Constitution and the advisability of its adoption;
Judge Melancton Smith, a native of Queens County, member of the
First Provincial Congress of New York from Dutchess County and an
opponent of Hamilton and Livingston in the Convention called to consider
the advisability of the ratification of the Federal Constitution; and
Judge Thomas Treadwell, a member of the First Provincial Congress
of New York and of the Convention called to formulate the First State
Constitution, who was also a member of the Convention called to consider
the Federal Constitution and the advisability of its adoption.</p>

<p>In a later period, it will be remembered that Hon. Matthew Hale,
Hon. Francis Lynde Stetson, Hon. John I. Gilbert, Hon. Richard L.
Hand, and others were natives of the Champlain valley.</p>

<p>Many judges have been natives of the Champlain valley. Some of
them have served in the courts of Vermont and New York, but more
have become residents of other states, and there filled judicial positions
in the state and Federal Courts. It would be interesting to record the
names of all such judges who had their birth in the Champlain valley, if
space permitted. We must content ourselves, however, with giving the
names of a few. The first of these to occur to one is Samuel Nelson,
born at Hebron, N. Y., November 10, 1792, who was a member of the
State Constitutional Conventions of 1821 and 1846, a Justice of the
Supreme Court of New York from 1831 to 1845, and a Judge of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Supreme Court of the United States from 1845 to 1872, one of the
longest judicial tenures ever held by a judge in this country.</p>

<p>The following may also be mentioned: Chancellor Reuben H. Walworth,
Samuel Hand, Judge of the Court of Appeals, Judges, John
C. Churchill, William Sweetland, John Lynde, Charles Henry Phelps,
Aldace F. Walker, Wheelock G. Veazey, William P. Kellogg, Henry
Chipman, Pliny Moore, John M. Parker, George Martin, Mark Skinner,
Charles L. Benedict, John Alexander Jameson, Melville A. Sheldon,
Eugene E. Sheldon, Walter C. Dunton, Perry G. Ellsworth, Joseph
Potter, S. Alonzo Kellogg, Chester B. McLaughlin, Winslow C. Watson,
Albert C. Barnes, Henry T. Kellogg, Jesse Walker, Thomas H.
Noonan, John H. Booth, and John B. Riley.</p>

<p>Only a few of the lawyers, who were natives of the Champlain valley,
can be mentioned out of the great number that have gone forth to take
up their residences elsewhere. Many of them have located in New York
and other Atlantic states, although a goodly number have located in the
Central and Western states, and are among the persons heretofore mentioned
as holding, or who have held official positions.</p>

<p>In addition to such, however, may also be mentioned George L. Clarke,
Hon. Smith M. Weed, Hon. George M. Beckwith, Hon. Robert
D. Benedict, Hon. Thomas F. Conway, Elroy N. Clark, Charles W.
Waterman, George Murray Wright, John C. Clark, Hon. John J. Allen,

<p>Among the natives of the Champlain valley who entered the Army
and Navy during the Civil War and since that time were Gen’l Wm. F.
Smith, Gen’l George J. Stannard, Gen’l William Wells, Col. Frank
Palmer, Col. George F. Nichols, Lieut. Matthew M. Standish, Gen’l<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Stephen Moffitt, Col. John Hammond, Rear-Admiral John W. Moore,
Commodore A. V. Wadhams, Admiral George Dewey, and many others,
who maintained the high standards of efficiency and bravery exhibited by
those who a century earlier participated in the engagements at Ticonderoga,
Bennington and Saratoga, and in the naval engagements of
Valcour and Plattsburgh Bay.</p>

<p>In addition to those already named, there have come from the Champlain
valley many to fill positions of responsibility in the state and nation,
of whom only the following few need be mentioned, viz., Loyal L.
Smith the philanthropist, Hon. John H. Converse, President of the
Baldwin Locomotive Works, Thomas Waterman Wood, President of
the National Academy of Design in 1891, Hon. Stephen A. Walker, at
one time Commissioner of the Board of Education of the State of New
York, Hon. Darwin P. Kingsley, President of the New York Life
Insurance Company, the late Dr. Abel Mix Phelps, the orthopedic surgeon,
Henry H. Vail, publisher of school books, Samuel Sheldon, expert

Brainerd and John M. Thomas, all of Middlebury College, Captain
John Alden Patridge, and Presidents Allen Danvers Brown and
Charles Horace Spooner, all of Norwich University. These were and
are representatives of the higher culture of its educational institutions.</p>

<p>There have also been many noted and learned professors, filling their
respective chairs in these educational institutions since their foundation,
with distinction. These institutions have maintained educational standards
so high that they have exerted a marked influence on the culture and
refinement of people residing in and outside of the valley. Other educational
institutions have also made their influence felt on students coming
from the Champlain valley, as well as on their graduates returning to it,
thereby contributing materially to the intellectual uplift of the people of
the territory. All this is evidenced by the large number of liberally
educated men and women who have gone forth to fill civic, technical,
professional, political and other positions with marked ability, in various
parts of the country.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Champlain valley are found in the Army, the
Navy and in all departments of the national Government, as well as in
the various state governments. They will also be found in the learned
professions, in commercial, technical, engineering, mechanical and
electrical pursuits, and are thus spreading abroad the professional, technical
and general information, which they have received in the institutions
of the Champlain valley and in the institutions outside of the Champlain
valley, which they attended.</p>

<p>If space permitted, it might be of interest to submit a bibliography of
the works of the authors, who have at various times lived in the Champlain
valley. A few only need be cited to show their character and scope.</p>

<p>In addition to his services as a civilian and a Major-General of the
State Militia, Ira Allen wrote the “National and Political History of
the State of Vermont,” and many state papers, wherein were treated

dispute, and the speech of Alexander Hamilton before a committee of
the Assembly in relation to the same matter, and the controversy as to
the boundary line between the two states, and other matters of interest
to both commonwealths, form a most important chapter in the early
history of the two states, and are contained in the Documentary History
of New York and the publications of the Vermont Historical Society.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the intellectual and moral culture of the people of

<p>Dr. Joseph Torrey, President of the University of Vermont, read an
important paper on “The Discovery and Occupation of Lake Champlain,”
before the Vermont Historical Society, on October 16, 1860,

Theory of Fine Art,” but he is widely known as the translator of
Neander’s “General History of the Christian Religion and Church.”</p>

<p>The works of George P. Marsh, for many years United States
Minister to Turkey and Italy, include “Lectures on the English Language,”

<p>Several works have heretofore been cited in this report relating to the
history of Lake Champlain, by persons residing in the valley and deeply
interested in its history. All these will be carefully examined by students
and writers of the events occurring in the Champlain valley.</p>

<p>Among the poets of the valley is John G. Saxe, born at Highgate,

<p>Rev. Joseph Cook, born at Ticonderoga in 1838, after pursuing his
studies in American and German universities, delivered several courses of
lectures in Boston, New York and elsewhere, on current topics and on
such subjects as “Transcendentalism,” “Orthodoxy,” etc., with such
clearness and force as to arouse deep interest in them, notwithstanding
their abstruseness. His lectures were published in book form and widely
read. His noted “Centennial Address” at Ticonderoga on July 25,
1864, is a valuable contribution to the history of Lake Champlain, in
which he took a deep interest. In some respects he was one of the best
informed living writers on the subject at the time of his death.</p>

<p>The Hon. Lucius E. Chittenden, born in Williston, Vt., May 24,

in the valley, is the author of “Waterways and Canal Construction in
New York State,” of “The Development of Constitutional Law in the
State of New York,” the framer of several constitutional provisions of
New York, a contributor to the Bibliophile edition of the works of

<p>These are a few of the native authors and writers of the Champlain
valley, and the list might be extended, if space permitted.</p>

<p>Others might be cited, but the foregoing will suffice to show the trend
of thought in the Champlain valley and that it has been quite as productive
of men of noble culture as any other part of the country. This
may have been lost sight of in the attention given to its more spectacular
and thrilling military and naval history. But for a century past, the
amenities of peace and the fruition of high ideals have accelerated its
intellectual and moral uplift and contributed to that general culture
which has long prevailed in the Champlain valley.</p>

<p>Its residents are for the most part well-trained, thoughtful, cultured
people. They thoroughly appreciated the Tercentenary exercises, as
well as the dedicatory ceremonies. The social as well as the atmospheric
conditions there are wholesome and invigorating, consequently it is fast
becoming the resort during the summer months of the people from the
metropolis and other cities, seeking rest and recreation under conditions
that are healthful and inspiring. The Tercentenary celebration brought
its advantages to the attention of a large portion of our population, who
may find in the Champlain valley such resorts as they need for health and
pleasure.</p>

<h3 id="PartIII_V">V. CONCLUSION OF THE WORK OF THE NEW YORK
LAKE CHAMPLAIN TERCENTENARY COMMISSION</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The work of the Commission was done largely through committees
after a presentation and consideration of such problems as arose
under instructions adopted at formal sessions of the Commission
from time to time with reference to the conduct of the celebration and
the construction of memorials. The Commission held upwards of thirty-seven
formal sessions and the results may be seen in the work accomplished.
From the first it was the purpose of the Commission to organize and carry
to a successful conclusion such a celebration as would be in keeping with
the dignity of the state and true to the historical events to be commemorated.
The members of the Commission fully appreciate their limitations
in undertaking to present in outline the history of the Champlain
valley in the form necessarily pursued in the Tercentenary Celebration,
which President Taft humorously characterized as a “traveling show,”
but there was no other way suggested or that occurred to members of
the Commission, whereby that could be done and any adequate presentation
of the tragic events following the discovery of the lake could
be made, than that adopted by the Commission.</p>

<p>Though there may not have been given “the substance,” the members
trust that they may not have failed to so present its essentials as to
enable many to behold something of what Professor William M. Sloane
denominates “the vision of history,” as unfolded in the Champlain valley.</p>


<h4 class="smcap fs100">Activities of the Tercentenary Commissioners</h4>

<p>The multifarious duties, devolving upon the members of Lake Champlain
Tercentenary Commission during the period of five years of its
existence, and involving activities of a wide range and great detail, may
never be fully appreciated nor even fully understood. The members of
the Commission were business and professional men actively engaged,
but they were so deeply interested in the celebration, that they left nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
undone to ensure its success. Senator James J. Frawley was chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Senate from 1911 and also a member
of another State Commission, Senator James A. Foley, who was a member
of Preliminary Champlain Commission, took a deep interest in the
project from its inception, Senator H. Wallace Knapp, chairman, Hon.
Walter C. Witherbee, treasurer, Hon. Howland Pell, whose family has
done much to restore Ft. Ticonderoga, Hon. Louis C. Lafontaine, Judges
John B. Riley and John H. Booth and Hon. James Shea, and Hon.
William R. Weaver, all freely gave their services and as much of their
time as they were able to the Tercentenary celebration.</p>

<p>At the final meeting of the New York Lake Champlain Tercentenary
Commission a resolution was adopted expressing the appreciation of its
members to its secretary, Henry W. Hill, for his long and unrequited
services in preparing the comprehensive, historical and scholarly First and
Final Reports of the Commission, which possess a literary finish and a
perfection in every detail worthy the commemorative Tercentenary celebration
and the bi-state, national and international functions involved.</p>

<p>In presenting their Final Report to the Legislature, the Tercentenary
Commissioners avail themselves of this opportunity to make it a matter of
record that they have had the support and active co-operation of the several
Governors and successive Legislatures of the state in office during the
life of the Commission in carrying to a successful conclusion the celebration
and in the construction and dedication of the two permanent memorials
to Samuel Champlain, the first white man to set foot on the soil of what
is now within the confines of the state. The Government of the United
States invited and, out of an appropriation made by it for that purpose,
entertained the foreign guests. The state of Vermont contributed its proportionate
share of the general expenses and of the cost of the joint memorial
at Crown Point forts. The state of New York paid its proportionate
share of the general expenses and of the cost of the joint memorial at
Crown Point forts and the entire cost of the Champlain memorial at Plattsburgh
and the Commission has turned a small balance back into the State
Treasury, as will appear from the Financial Statement in the <a href="#App_V">Appendix</a>
of this Final Report.</p>

<p class="pfs70">Sixtieth Congress, Second Session. House of Representatives. Report No. 2169</p>

<p class="center smcap">Tercentenary Celebration of Discovery of Lake Champlain</p>

<p class="pfs70">February 15, 1909—Referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster, of Vermont, from the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
submitted the following report.</p>

<p class="pfs70">[To accompany H. J. Res. 257.]</p>

<p class="drop-capy">The committee on Foreign Affairs, to whom was referred House
joint resolution 257, submit the following report [taken from the
joint memorial presented to Congress by the New York and
Vermont Tercentenary Commissions in January 1909.]</p>

<p>In the month of November, 1906, a joint resolution for the appointment
of a commission for the celebration of the three hundredth anniversary
of the discovery of Lake Champlain was adopted by the senate
and house of representatives of the State of Vermont, containing the
recital that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas, The discovery of Lake Champlain was an event in history fully as important
as many others that have been recognized by various states as well as by the
National Government; and</p>

<p>Whereas, The three hundredth anniversary of such discovery will occur on July 4,
1909, it is hereby</p>

<p><em>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives</em>, That this event should be
observed in a fitting manner and bring about an observance commensurate with its
importance, there is hereby provided a commission consisting of the governor, who
shall be chairman ex-officio, and six other members to be appointed by the governor
before January 1, 1907, one of whom shall act as secretary. Said commission
is hereby empowered to adopt such measures as in its judgment may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
reasonable or necessary to bring about the fitting observance of such event. And as
the interests of the State of New York and of the Dominion of Canada are allied
with those of Vermont in such observance, it is hereby recommended that said
commission confer with the proper authorities of New York and Canada to ascertain
what action they or either of them will take with Vermont in making the
observance of this event successful and a credit to all, and that the commission
report the result of such efforts, together with its recommendations, to the general
assembly of 1908—</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which resolution was approved by Governor Fletcher D. Proctor on
November 15, 1906; and thereafter Governor Proctor appointed as
members of such commission Walter E. Howard, of Middlebury;
Horace W. Bailey, of Newbury; R. W. McCuen, of Vergennes; Lynn
M. Hays, of Essex Junction; Walter H. Crockett, of St. Albans;
M. D. McMahon, of Burlington; and thereafter, on April 15, 1907, on
motion of Senator Henry W. Hill, of Buffalo, the senate of the State
of New York adopted the following resolution, which was concurred
in by the assembly on April 16, 1907:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> the discovery of Lake Champlain by Samuel Champlain on July 4,
1609, antedates the discovery by the whites of any other portion of the territory
now comprising the State of New York, and was an event worthy of commemoration
in the annals of the State and nation; and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> the State of Vermont in 1906 appointed a commission, consisting of
the governor of that State and six other commissioners, to confer with commissioners
to be appointed on the part of New York and the Dominion of Canada, to ascertain
what action, if any, ought to be taken by such States and the Dominion of Canada
for the observance of such tercentenary: Therefore</p>

<p><em>Resolved (if the Assembly concur)</em>, That a commission consisting of the governor,
who shall be chairman ex-officio, two citizens to be designated by him, the lieutenant-governor,
the speaker of the assembly, two senators to be designated by the
lieutenant-governor, and two members of the assembly to be designated by the
speaker, be appointed to represent the State of New York at such conference, with
power to enter into negotiations with the commissioners representing the State of
Vermont and those representing the Dominion of Canada for the observance of
such tercentenary, and that such commission report the results of their negotiations,
together with the recommendations thereon, to the legislature of 1908.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>The New York commission appointed under the foregoing resolution
consisted of Governor Charles E. Hughes, Lieutenant-Governor Lewis
Stuyvesant Chanler, Senators Henry W. Hill, John C. R. Taylor, and
Assemblyman James W. Wadsworth, jr., speaker of the assembly,
Alonson T. Dominy, James A. Foley, and Frank S. Witherbee and
John H. Booth.</p>

<p>That commission, together with the Vermont commission, during the
summer of 1907 made a tour of Lake Champlain, held several joint and
separate meetings, and the New York commission formulated its report
and transmitted it to the New York legislature of 1908, a copy of which
is annexed hereto, in the conclusion of which report they recommend as
follows:</p>


<h4>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF 1909.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your commission respectfully submit the foregoing report to the consideration of
the legislature of New York. The anniversary which we desire shall be suitably
observed has great significance. Important as it is to the student of history, it
makes a wider and stronger appeal to that large body of our citizens whose forefathers
fought in the wars of the Champlain region or were among the pioneers who
transformed it from the wilderness.</p>

<p>But chief of all the considerations which we urge upon your attention is the international
character of the proposed celebration. The history of the Champlain
Valley belongs to the history of three great nations, whose cordial relations we
believe will be promoted by the suitable observance of this significant date.</p>


<h4>RECOMMENDATION.</h4>

<p>To that end your commission, after careful investigation, reaches the conclusion
that the three hundredth anniversary of the discovery of Lake Champlain should
be suitably celebrated by New York State; and to that end we respectfully recommend
the enactment of the following bill.</p>
</div>

<p>Thereafter a bill was prepared and submitted to the legislature, which
was amended in some respects, and subsequently enacted and became
chapter 149 of the New York Laws of 1908, providing in substance for
a celebration of the tercentenary of the discovery of Lake Champlain
by Samuel Champlain in the month of July, 1609, which celebration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
by the terms of the bill, is to occur in the month of July, 1909, at various
points in the Champlain valley.</p>

<p>The commission appointed thereunder consisted of H. Wallace
Knapp, Mooers, N. Y., chairman; Henry W. Hill, of Buffalo, secretary;
Walter C. Witherbee, Port Henry, treasurer; James J. Frawley, New
York City; James Shea, Lake Placid; James A. Foley, New York
City; John H. Booth, Plattsburgh; John B. Riley, Plattsburgh; Louis
C. Lafontaine, Champlain; Howland Pell, New York City.</p>

<p>This commission was empowered under the last-mentioned statute to
enter into negotiations and co-operate with the State of Vermont, the
Government of the United States, the Dominion of Canada, and the
Province of Quebec, and either or all of them in such tercentenary celebration,
and appropriated by chapter 466 of the New York Laws of
1908 the sum of $50,000 for that purpose.</p>

<p>The Vermont commission made its report to the legislature of Vermont,
held in the fall of 1908, also recommending, among other things,
that a proper celebration be held in conjunction with the State of New
York, the Government of the United States, and the Dominion of
Canada, a copy of which report is annexed hereto. Subsequently the
State of Vermont made an appropriation of $25,000 to enable that
State to participate in the tercentenary celebration.</p>

<p>The commission appointed thereunder consisted of Governor George
H. Prouty, chairman; Lynn M. Hays, of Burlington, secretary; Walter
H. Crockett, of St. Albans; Rev. John M. Thomas, of Middlebury;
Horace W. Bailey, of Rutland; W. J. Van Patten, of Burlington;
Frank L. Fish, of Vergennes; Arthur L. Stone, of St. Johnsbury; and
F. O. Beaupre, of Burlington.</p>

<p>The facts warranting federal appropriation are briefly set forth in the
report of the New York and Vermont commissions, and in amplification
thereof the following additional facts are respectfully submitted to the
consideration of the President and the Congress of the United States:</p>

<p>Long before its discovery by Samuel Champlain, in July, 1609, Lake
Champlain was the resort and battle ground of the savage Algonquin,
Huron, and Iroquois nations who peopled its islands and circumjacent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
beautifully shaded and picturesque shores. It was a paradise for the
aborigines, whose native customs and adventurous but precarious life were
a startling revelation to such an explorer as Champlain, coming as he
did from the refinements of French life of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. Still he was hospitably received and escorted to and through
the lake, then known as “Caniaderiguarunte,” which signifies the “gate
of the country.” The lake was also known as “Mer des Iroquois,” and
traversed by the warring Indian tribes, whose canoes formed picturesque
flotillas in those early days on the blue waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Had Champlain been gifted with the poetic imagination of a Homer
or a Virgil, he might have cast into an epic the story of his explorations
and discoveries, which were quite as thrilling as those of the Iliad, the
Odyssey, or the Aeneid. Other poets have dwelt upon the beauties of
this lake and have sung of the tragic events that have occurred on its
waters.</p>

<p>The Champlain valley is one of the historic portions of the American
Continent. Its Indian occupation was succeeded by that of the French,
and in turn by the English. From its discovery in July, 1609, to the
battle of Plattsburgh, in September, 1814, Lake Champlain was the
thoroughfare of many expeditions and the scene of many sanguinary
engagements. Noted French, British, and American officers visited it
and stopped at its forts, from Ste. Anne on the north, founded at Isle
La Motte in 1665, to St. Frédéric, founded in honor of the French secretary
of foreign affairs, Frédéric Maurepas, by Marquis de Beauharnois,
governor-general of Canada, at Crown Point in 1731, and Fort
Carillon, founded at Ticonderoga in 1766, on the south.</p>

<p>The grants of some of its islands and adjacent shore lands under
French seignories were the subject of a long controversy between the
French and British Governments, challenging on the one side the consideration
of such officials as Marquis de Beauharnois and others under
Louis XV and Louis XVI, and on the other side such statesmen as
Lord Dartmouth, Edmund Burke, and Sir Henry Moore under the
British Crown. But few, if any, occupations were made under French
seignorial grants, and the controversy finally ended after the Seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Years’ French and Indian war, which terminated with the capture of
Ticonderoga and Crown Point by the British in 1759, and the later
sovereign control by the Americans during the Revolution.</p>

<p>The Champlain valley was the scene of important military and one
naval engagement during the Revolutionary war, and permission has
been obtained from the War Department to raise from the waters of
Lake Champlain the <i>Royal Savage</i> at Valcour Island, the flagship of
Benedict Arnold during that engagement. The history of Ticonderoga
and Macdonough’s victory at the battle of Plattsburgh, in September
1814, are of such national importance as to merit federal consideration
during the forthcoming celebration of the discovery of the lake.</p>

<p>For two hundred years or longer the Champlain valley was the highway
between Albany on the south and Quebec on the north, through
which surged the tides of war and travel, until every prominent point
and important island in the lake was marked by some notable event
worthy of historic mention. The proposed celebration of the discovery
of the lake will commemorate some of these important events.

Sewall S. Cutting</ins>, D. D., in a poem read at the University of Vermont in 1877
thus describes some of these events. He says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>
<p>No part of the United States can vie in comparison with Lake Champlain
and its environs for historic importance and the ultimate significance
of the national and international events occurring in that valley.
“Every bay and island of the lake and nearly every foot of its shore
have been the scene of some warlike movement—the midnight foray
of the predatory savage, the bloody scout of frontier settlers, the rendezvous
of armed bands, or the conflict of contending armies.” These
stirring events cover a period of centuries—from the traditional history
of the Indians to the close of the war of 1812.</p>

<p>From the earliest periods of settlement in Canada, New England,
and New York the valley of Lake Champlain, both as watercourse or
highway, served as a thoroughfare by which, in hostile times, predatory
excursions were directed against both the French and English
frontiers, and over which captives were conveyed into unenviable captivity.
This was the route traversed by delegations engaged in diplomatic
relations between the French and English colonists, and was used
by agents employed to arrange an exchange of captives. The valley
was a highway of commerce, particularly in the operations of the fur
trade. Its Indian name, meaning “door of the country,” was an apt
designation, for into it there marched the flower of contending armies
of France, England, and the United States, who struggled persistently
for its control. The destinies of the United States and Canada and of
England’s colonial policy were largely decided by what occurred in the
Champlain valley.</p>

<p>An unjust historical perspective is often created by placing too high
value upon the significance of figures. Large armies do not always
count for as much in their influence upon the course of the world’s
history as events more hidden from view and surrounded with less of
glamour. The one more easily bewitches the eyes, but the other is
more likely to appeal to reason. The history of the Champlain valley
exhibits in relief momentous martial and naval engagements and in
intaglio the deeds of individuals and collections of men pregnant with
far-reaching results in the evolution of the continent of North America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>Samuel Champlain laid the foundations of New France at Quebec in
1608, and in 1609 led an expedition into the Richelieu River, accompanied
by a retinue of Algonquian and other Canadian Indians. At
the falls of Chambly he abandoned the vessel in which he had sailed,
and by portaging and canoeing reached the entrance of a great lake,
which he named Lake Champlain. Its confines constituted one of the
hunting grounds of the well-organized Iroquoian Confederacy. The
Iroquois were then at great enmity with the Algonquians and the
Canadian Hurons.</p>

<p>On the night of July 29, 1609, Champlain fell in with one of the
hunting parties of the Iroquois. They spent the night in parleying
and uttering defiance at one another, and on the morning of July 30
the now well-known battle of Champlain took place at or near the site
of Ticonderoga, as is generally believed by the best historians. The
significance of this battle is attested by the alienation of the Iroquois
from the French and their affiliation with the Dutch and English, and
was one of the embryonic factors which, under development, ultimately
saved northern New York and a large contiguous territory to English
instead of French interests.</p>

<p>France claimed the region by right of discovery, but England sought
to repress her by the limitations of treaty. In 1731 France violated the
compact of peace by the erection of Fort St. Frédéric on the peninsula
known better as Crown Point. The Iroquois, as claimants of territorial
ownership, in June, 1737, protested against the French occupation.
In 1739 the French commandant promised the Iroquois that
France would not encroach or settle south of Fort St. Frédéric, but
he claimed for his King all the watershed of the St. Lawrence, inclusive
of Lake Champlain and Lake George. In 1742 the fort, having been
enlarged, was the strongest work held by the French in Canada—Quebec
and Louisburg only excepted. The five years’ war, familiarly
known as King George’s war, involved the subjects of France and
England in conflict, both in Europe and in America. A nominal peace
was established by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748. But soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
the Acadian and other boundary contentions between the two Crowns
were in ferment.</p>

<p>France practiced subtlety in her diplomatic negotiations, strengthened
her frontier posts, and inoculated her Indian allies with hatred of
her English colonial neighbors. In 1755 she built Fort Carillon, afterwards
Ticonderoga, and thus advanced her outposts. Henceforth, and
in a seven years’ war, Fort Carillon and Ticonderoga bore the brunt
of frontier aggrandizement. In August of that year Dieskau occupied
Crown Point with 700 regulars, 1,600 Canadians, and 700 Indians.
In 1756, 2,000 men of France were engaged on Fort Carillon; in 1757
it was garrisoned with 9,000 men under the Marquis de Montcalm.
On July 8, 1758, Abercromby, with regulars and provincials, unsuccessfully
stormed its works and lost nearly 2,000 men. In the same
year Robert Rogers, the intrepid ranger, lost 125 out of a total of
180 men. Upon the evacuation of the region by the French in 1759
General Amherst took possession of Ticonderoga in July, and of Crown
Point in August. In 1760 Amherst assembled an army of 15,000
men at Crown Point, and in August of that year Colonel Haviland,
with about 3,300 men, opened fire upon the French post at Isle aux
Noix, forced the French commander, Bourlamaque, to withdraw, and
captured the garrison that remained behind.</p>

<p>For a time after the treaty of Paris, in 1763, the region rested in
comparative quiescence. England’s acquisition by treaty of the vast
domain of Canada eradicated the long-standing imbroglios with France
in North America; but the intercolonial wars had schooled the English-American
colonists in the arts of prowess and of war. The colonists
also had greater freedom to consider internal interests, being now
relieved from the erstwhile collisions with the French. A narrow
colonial policy lent itself toward the growth of a spirit of resentment
in the colonies, and England’s determination to enforce obedience to
her will by the employment of military authority served only to fan
the slumbering embers into a conflagration. It was under these conditions
in May, 1775, that the audacious Ethan Allen, accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
only about 83 men, surprised the English garrison at Fort Ticonderoga
and that Seth Warner took Crown Point, in each case without
bloodshed. When De la Place, the English officer at Ticonderoga,
asked Allen by what authority he demanded the fort’s surrender, he
replied with these now memorable words: “By the authority of the
Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress.” The personality of
Allen was and is yet a subject of academic controversy, but his action
in this affair is a landmark in the romantic history of America.</p>

<p>Benedict Arnold has been execrated for his treason to his country,
yet his name is connected with one of the greatest of patriotic services
during the American Revolution. On October 11, 1776, he engaged
in an extraordinary naval battle on Lake Champlain against the overwhelming
odds of the British fleet under Sir Guy Carleton. This
battle is in our naval annals of the Revolution what Bunker Hill is to our
military history—“a battle wherein glory and renown were gained in
defeat.” Spears, the naval historian, has characterized it thus: “Not
only was the moral effect of this battle quite as great in the courage it
gave the Americans, and the pause for thought it gave the enemy; it
served to head off a victorious invading British army bound for Albany
and the subjugation of northern New York. It taught the British that
the Americans were not only willing, but they were able fighters. In
spite of the tremendous odds against them, at the last they had proved
themselves as unyielding as the rocks that echoed back the roar of the
conflict.”</p>

<p>Burgoyne made an unsuccessful attack upon the American occupants
of Fort Ticonderoga in June, 1777, but with 7,000 men had
forced the abandonment of Crown Point in that month; and in July,
having erected a battery on Mount Defiance, which commanded Fort
Ticonderoga, forced the Americans to evacuate it on the night of the
6th. The termination of the American Revolution, save for internal
controversies between New York and Vermont, ended the storm and
stress period in the Champlain valley for many years, until our second
war with Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>From September 6 to 11, 1814, various land engagements took place
about Plattsburgh. The British forces, numbering about 11,500 troops
and including many of Lord Wellington’s veterans, were under Sir
George Prevost, governor and commander-in-chief in British North
America; the Americans, commanded by Macomb and Bissell, numbered
4,500 men. On September 11, 1814, the American navy on the
lake, commanded by Thomas Macdonough, defeated the British squadron
under the command of Commodore George Downie. This naval
battle was crucial in bringing the war of 1812 to a termination. The
success was acclaimed by the American people everywhere by rejoicing,
bonfires, and illuminations, and was sung in the folk and war ballads
of the day. Congress recognized its national significance by officially
thanking the whole force engaged, and by voting gold medals to Macdonough,
Henley, and Cassin, and a silver medal to each of the other
commissioned officers. In this victory the United States gained prestige
for the demands of the treaty of peace, and an estoppel was put upon
England’s endeavor to get possession of the northeast corner of the
State of Maine.</p>

<p>If the lake itself was the door of the whole northern country, Larrabee’s
Point, on the Vermont side, opposite Fort Ticonderoga, was a
side door to New England, and from that side door the New England
frontiers suffered repeatedly the havoc of Indian devastations. But
there are other places, besides those hitherto mentioned, whose historic
associations are inseparable from a narration of the landmarks of the
Champlain valley. At Burlington, Vt., the first steamboat on the
lake was launched in 1808 and bore the name of that state. This was
only a year <ins class="corr" id="tn-233" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'after Fulton’ steamer'">
after Fulton’s steamer</ins>, the <i>Clermont</i>, first plied the Hudson
from New York to Albany. Shortly thereafter, during the period of
our second war with Great Britain, Burlington was a garrisoned post
and a base of supplies.</p>

<p>On the Isle La Motte (named from Pierre de St. Paul, sieur de la
Motte-Lusière, a captain of the famous Carignan regiment), the French
built a fort in 1666, which was named Ste. Anne, and in July of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
year, while garrisoned by several companies of the regiment above
alluded to, was invested by hostile Mohawks, whose depredations
included the death of Captains de Traversy and de Chazy. In October,
1666, M. de Tracy, governor-general of New France, guided and
assembled an expedition on the Isle La Motte for the purpose of chastising
the Iroquois. Twelve hundred combatants, borne by a fleet of
300 bateaux and canoes, and strengthened by two pieces of artillery,
were engaged. They penetrated to the remotest hamlets of these
Indians and planted the arms of France, in token of taking formal possession
of the whole northern part of New York. The French remained
undisturbed from the Mohawks for nearly a quarter of a century. Fort
Ste. Anne became a Jesuit mission station and was visited by Bishop
Laval in 1668. In August, 1690, Capt. John Schuyler camped there
during his return from a foray into Canada. Gens. Philip Schuyler
and Richard Montgomery met on the island in September, 1775, during
their advance against St. John’s and Montreal, and laid there the plans
for that invasion of Canada. Now the shrine of Ste. Anne, on the west
side of the island, is visited annually by thousands of devout pilgrims.</p>

<p>Maj. Robert Rogers and 142 men came into Missisquoi Bay in the
autumn of 1760, secreted their boats and some provisions, and went off
on an expedition against the St. Francis Indians, near the village of
Three Rivers, which they burned. Earlier in that year this same
intrepid ranger had landed at the place called Rouse’s Point, near
which he was attacked by a superior body of French from the Isle aux
Noix. The French were defeated and their commander was slain.</p>

<p>Swanton, in Vermont, at an early period formed a considerable settlement
of the French and Indians, being then “probably the largest
in the Champlain valley with the exception of Crown Point.” At the
mouth of Otter Creek, the largest river in Vermont, where Fort Cassin
was built, the American squadron was fitted out in 1814 for battle
against the English navy. This fort was named for Lieutenant Cassin
of our navy, who, with Captain Thornton of the United States Artillery,
in May, 1814, had defended the American fleet then building
there from attempted destruction by the British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>A little to the north of Rouse’s Point are the ruins of Fort Montgomery,
built by error in what was then Canadian soil, and often
called on that account “Fort Blunder,” but corrected by international
boundary concessions. Rouse’s Point is a place of commercial interest
and the most important port of entry on this frontier. Near by is
Point au Fer, fortified in 1776 by the patriot General Sullivan, but
occupied by the British in June of the next year and relinquished by
them only as late as 1788. At Valcour Island, off Bluff Point and
Hotel Champlain, the scene of Arnold’s naval battle of 1776, the
wreck of the <i>Royal Savage</i> lies under water to this day as a reminder
of the beginnings of our national naval adventures. At the head of
the lake to the south, near the present Whitehall, Maj. Israel Putnam,
in August, 1758, was engaged in watching the enemy’s maneuvers,
and had a fierce encounter in the forest with French and Indians. He
was captured, tied to a tree by the Indians, who made preparations
to roast him alive. Only the stern interposition of the French officer,
Marin, prevented them from dispatching him thus cruelly and robbing
the patriot cause of one of its bravest leaders during the American
Revolution.</p>

<p>The New York and Champlain commissions have concluded contracts
with Mr. L. O. Armstrong, of Montreal, to present Indian
pageants on Lake Champlain during the tercentenary celebration. These
will be presented by 150 native Indians, descendants of the original
tribes that occupied portions of the Champlain valley at the time of its
discovery by Champlain. They will reproduce the battle of Samuel
Champlain with the Iroquois and also present a dramatic version of
Longfellow’s Hiawatha on floating barges anchored on the waters of
the lake at various places where exercises are to be held.</p>

<p>It is desirable that the United States detail national troops and the
States of New York and Vermont regiments from the National Guard
to present military pageants at Ticonderoga, Plattsburgh, and Burlington.
The two commissions have decided to hold formal exercises on
July 5, 1909, at Crown Point, on July 6 at Fort Ticonderoga, on July<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
7 at Plattsburgh, on July 8 at Burlington, and on July 9 at Isle La
Motte, at each of which places Indian pageants will be presented.</p>

<p>The proposed celebration of the discovery of Lake Champlain may
also include a celebration of such colonial, national, and international
events occurring since the discovery of the lake as to make it eminently
proper that the Government of the United States officially participate
in the exercises commemorating these historical events. Historical
addresses and other literary exercises are to be held, and it is important
that the United States Government invite and entertain representatives
of the Republic of France, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and
the Dominion of Canada. The celebration is of national and international
importance, and the committee recommends that the resolution
do pass.</p>

<p class="drop-capy"><ins class="corr" id="tn-239" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'no drop-cap'">
The</ins> Crown Point forts standing within the confines of the State
Reservation at Crown Point, were frequently mentioned during the Tercentenary
celebration exercises as well as during the dedicatory ceremonies
of the Champlain memorials.</p>

<p>They are of historical and public interest, now that they belong to the
State, through the generosity of Witherbee, Sherman &amp; Co., and will be
preserved from further devastation.</p>

<p>Fort Frédéric was built by Marquis de Beauharnois in honor of the
French Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Frédéric Maurepas, in 1731. The
English forts were constructed under the supervision of General Jeffrey
Amherst as will appear from the following excerpts of the official “Correspondence
of William Pitt,” edited by Gertrude Selwin Kimball and
published by the Macmillan Company.</p>

<p>In his report under date of Crown Point, August 5, 1759, General
Amherst says: “I arrived at Crown Point [August 4th] before the
evening, landed and posted all corps. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> I ordered [August 5th]
Lt. Colonel Eyre to trace out the ground for a Fort, which I will set
about with all possible expedition.” Correspondence of William Pitt,
Vol. 2, pp. 147-148, published by the Macmillan Company.</p>

<p>General Amherst in his report under date of Crown Point October 22,
1759, to William Pitt, says “to make the fortress as formidable as I
can I ordered with the advise of the Engineer three Forts to be erected,
which I named the Grenadier Fort, the light Infantry Fort, &amp; Gages
light Infantry Fort, ordering those Corps’s to build each their own as
fast as possible.” Correspondence of William Pitt, Vol. 2, p. 191.</p>

<p>In a later report under date of New York December 16, 1759, to
William Pitt, General Amherst (on November 10, 1759, that being the
birthday of George II), says: “The Troops worked till three o’clock,
excepting the Grenadiers, who were under Arms at one o’clock and fired
Volleys. <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> The three Forts firing 21 Cannon, and the Battalions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
volleys. The Fortress 21 Cannon, the Army a running fire, the
Park of Artillery 21 Cannon, the Army a general volley <span class="nowrap">* * *.</span>”
Correspondence of William Pitt, Vol. 2, p. 222.</p>

<p>Again in a later report under date of New York, January 7, 1761, to
William Pitt, General Amherst says: “The works of the Fortress of
Crown Point, and of the Forts of Oswego, Pittsburg, and Fort Stanwix,
are not finished so much as I could wish, and I judge, it will be proper
to compleat them in the Spring, and that the Provincials should furnish
men for this Service.” Correspondence of William Pitt, Vol. 2, p. 382.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the fortress at Crown Point was not completed in
1761, and in fact it was never fully completed.</p>

<p>It does not appear from the foregoing correspondence between General
Amherst and William Pitt or from any of the official reports of General
Amherst that the fortress at Crown Point was officially named “Fort
Amherst,” as it was occasionally denominated in common parlance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Additional light is thrown on the early history of the region in the
papers of Victor Hugo Paltsits, State Historian, and W. Max Reid,
on the Rock Inscription at Crown Point, found in the New York State
Historical Association Publications [Vol. X, pp. 106-113]. In the
papers of Mr. Reid, he says that “The Earl of Waldegrave writes
to the Board of Trade, June 13th, 1732: ‘the French have caused a
fort to be built <span class="nowrap">* * *</span> at a place called <i lang="fr">Pointe de la Couronne</i>,
in English, Crown Point.’” [N. Y. Hist. Assoc. Pub. X, p. 113.]</p>

Therein will be found a discussion of the demand made by

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Whereas, agreeable to the Power and Authority to us given by the Colony
of Connecticut, we have appointed you to take the command of a party of men and
reduce and take possession of the garrison of Ticonderoga and its dependencies,
and as you are now in possession of the same,—You are hereby directed to keep
the command of said garrison, for the use of the American Colonies, till you have
further orders from the Colony of Connecticut or from the Continental Congress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ticonderoga</span>, <em>May 10th, 1775</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing order appears to have been issued without direct
authorization, but it was acquiesced in by Col. Arnold, who submitted
to the command of Col. Allen and accompanied him in the attack.
They were guided by young Nathan Beman, who was familiar with
every passage of approach to the fort. After the capture of Ticonderoga,
Captain Mott returned to Hartford and was sent to Philadelphia
to inform Congress of the capture of Ticonderoga. And thereafter he
resumed command of his company in the northern army and was present
at the taking of Chambly and the surrender of St. John’s. His elder
brother, Samuel, was appointed engineer and was stationed at Ticonderoga<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and Crown Point, and in August became Chief Engineer under
General Schuyler of the northern army. Captain Edward Mott became
major in the regiment under Col. Gay. The devotion and distinguished
services of Captain Mott and Samuel Mott, his brother, during the Revolution
were recognized in their rapid promotion in the northern army.</p>

<p class="pfs70">State Geologist of Vermont</p>

<p class="drop-capy">It is undoubted that the Champlain valley at the time when the first
Europeans entered the region was occupied by two great Indian
peoples, the Confederacy of the Six Nations and the Algonkins or
Abnaki. To the Six Nations the name Iroquois was generally given by
the French explorers. They held full sway over the New York side
of the Champlain valley, but the occupancy of the eastern, or Vermont,
side is less certain. There can be no question that this side of the valley
was possessed by the Algonkins for the greater part of the time, but there
are several centuries when it is not easy to determine certainly the precise
relations of these two peoples. Most of what became New England
and the Atlantic border and a vast territory in Canada was always, so
far as can be now discovered, occupied by the Algonkins who also reached
far westward and southward through the Mississippi valley. The Iroquois
occupied a comparatively small area about lakes Erie and Ontario and
eastward along the St. Lawrence, including the whole of what is now
New York, as well as parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and a long,
narrow strip of Canada north of New York.</p>

<p>They also occupied territory in the south, west of the Carolinas. How
long or how completely the Iroquois possessed the Vermont side of the
Champlain valley we may never know, but it appears to be pretty certain
that they did for a time, and probably several times, dispossess the usual
owners and hold as their own the entire shore of Champlain. It appears
from various records that sometime about 1540 the Iroquois were in control
of both sides of the lake and of the Vermont as well as the New York
shores. It also appears that these people held the region for a century
when they withdrew. Why they retired to the western side is not plain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Considering their warlike disposition and reputation and the very great
fear in which they were held by the Algonkins it is impossible to believe
that these latter drove them back across the lake, and yet why they should
have voluntarily left their eastern possessions one cannot readily explain.</p>

<p>In 1640 Father Ducreux made a map of the region and on this map
Lake Champlain is made the western boundary of the Algonkin territory,
so that by this time the ownership had again changed.</p>

<p>In 1690, as is well known, the Algonkins and French destroyed
Schenectady and, though their force was very small, they appear to have
passed without any difficulty through the Champlain valley, and had it
been occupied by Mohawks or any Iroquois tribe this could not have
been possible.</p>

<p>At different times for many years various Vermont legislatures were
beset by claims which the Caughnawaga Indians persistently entered.
These claims were for remuneration for land taken by the white men from
their ancestors and which they declared were formerly the property of
their tribe.</p>

<p>The territory which the Caughnawagas claimed was finally defined by
them as bounded by Lake Champlain on the west and on the east by the
mountain ranges which divide the waters running into Lake Champlain
<ins class="corr" id="tn-248" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'from the Mississquoi'">
from the Missisquoi</ins>, Lamoille and Winooski rivers from those which run
into the Connecticut, together with so much of the land drained by Otter
creek as would be embraced by a line drawn from Ticonderoga to the
sources of the Winooski.</p>

<p>So far as can be ascertained by examination of documents, the validity
or invalidity of this claim was neither denied nor allowed, but the claim
was never in any way granted. As intimated, it was repeatedly advanced
at different sessions of the General Assembly until finally abandoned in
1874. From the persistency with which the Indians brought forward
their claim it seems probable that whether it had any substantial basis
or not, they really believed that it had.</p>

<p>In a very full and interesting discussion of this question, Mr. D. P.
Thompson in an Appendix to the History of Montpelier, Vt., writes as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
follows: “In the published journal of the expedition of Champlain when
in the summer of 1609 he discovered the lake that bears his name we
have full and direct evidence that the Iroquois were in possession of just
about the same tract of territory in Vermont as that to which their
descendants have latterly been laying claim as a part of their original
domain.”</p>

<p>Champlain also found that the Algonkins were at war with the Iroquois
and, as this author suggests, this war may very likely have grown out of
the encroachment of the Iroquois upon this territory which formerly had
belonged to the Algonkins. Moreover, Champlain states in his narrative
that when he asked his companions who lived on the east shores of the
lake through which they were passing they told him that they were
Iroquois. It also appears to be true that the early French explorers called
Lake Champlain the Lake or Sea of the Iroquois. However, while the
Algonkins admitted at the time of Champlain’s visit that the Iroquois
held the Champlain valley on both sides, they asserted that it originally
belonged to them, as it was occupied by their forefathers. The truth,
so far as it can be ascertained, appears to be that the first inhabitants of
the western side of the Champlain valley were Iroquois, and those of the
eastern side were Algonkins; that at some time before 1540 the Iroquois
crossed the lake and drove out the people then living on the eastern side,
and for many, perhaps a hundred, years, themselves occupied that territory.
In or about 1640, for reasons not discoverable, they left the eastern
shores and all the territory now included in Vermont and no further
trace of them appears in that region. How long the Champlain valley
was occupied by these two peoples can never be known, or whether at
any early time some other and different people roamed over the region.
All that we do know or can know is that at the coming of the white men,
and for at least several centuries before, these and only these tribes
were here.</p>

<p>Turning now to a consideration of some of the evidence of former
occupation which these peoples have left we find a great variety of implements
and weapons of stone and a smaller number of copper and iron.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
Household utensils, simple and few as were the needs of people, who were
in the stone age of civilization, are also found made of stone, earthenware
and bone. A detailed enumeration of these, though of great interest to
the archæologist would be tedious to the general reader. For this reason
only a general account of these objects will be given.</p>

<p>From what has been written above it will be obvious that practically
all of the objects found on the New York side of the valley are of Iroquois
origin, but of those found in Vermont we may be sure that many are
Algonkin. It is also sure that mingled with these there must be many
of Iroquoian origin. When, however, we attempt to decide which of the
implements or other objects are Algonkian and which Iroquoian we undertake
a very difficult task. Some of the pottery and some of the stone
objects are plainly of Iroquois manufacture and others are Algonkian,
but most of our specimens are not to be classified. The Iroquois were
superior in culture to other tribes and their handiwork is finer as a whole,
but after all the quality of the work does not, as a rule, at all suffice to
distinguish between their implements and others. Quite extensive collections
have been made on both sides of the lake, and when these are
compared very great similarity is at once observed. And yet there are
some differences though, as has been indicated, not enough to differentiate
one group from the other. It is noticeable that in any considerable collection
of objects of Indian manufacture from the Champlain valley, there
are many of exceedingly fine workmanship. No better specimens of their
kind are to be found anywhere than the best of our Champlain valley
specimens. Probably because of the rocky and, at times inaccessible,
character of the western shore, and the more level and inhabitable nature
of the Vermont shores, Indian relics of all sorts have been found in much
greater abundance on the eastern than on the western side of the lake.</p>

<p>Much of the New York shore is rugged and affords no good camping
ground or village sites, while the Vermont shores are mostly level, or
nearly so, and offer abundant invitation to wandering tribes to remain. And
yet, as Champlain informs the reader, there were in his day no permanent
villages because of hostilities. The whole Champlain valley, or at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
rate that part of it which adjoins the lake, was unsafe territory to the
long-staying camper, and still more to those who would establish a
village. War or hunting parties might traverse its forests, but none might
safely tarry long.</p>

<p>As every collector of Indian relics well knows, it is about the camp,
or better still, village sites that most abundant specimens occur, and as
these are very few in the immediate vicinity of the lake so the number of
objects found is comparatively small as compared to such localities as the
Ohio or Mississippi region. Still some thousands of specimens have
been collected along the shores of Lake Champlain and in their immediate
neighborhood. As everywhere, the spear and arrow points, and similarly
shaped knives, are by far the most abundant of all objects that have been
found. These chipped points are almost always made from hard, often
quartzose rock, and are of many forms and various degrees of excellence.
By far the greater number are of a gray quartzite which is abundant in
ledges in the region. The most common form on both sides of the lake
is the simple triangle. This shape occurs of many sizes from little points
a half inch long to those that are four or five inches long. They may
be narrow or broad, usually without haft or barb, though these may be
present in some of the less common specimens. While none are as large
as the larger flaked implements of the west, some are several inches long,
a few of the very largest being seven or eight. Some few of the points
are as finely proportioned and elegantly made as can be found anywhere,
though as a rule the flaked objects are less attractive than those from the
west. This is partly due to the color and texture of the material, for the
quartzites, etc., of the east are much less prettily colored than those
which are found in the west or middle west. Finely barbed and
stemmed points and knives are less abundant than the simpler forms, but
many specimens occur and some are very finely made.</p>

<p>Besides these points other chipped or flaked objects are found, such as
scrapers and drills. A form of point or, more probably, knife is found
more commonly, I think, in the Champlain valley than elsewhere, though
not peculiar to this region. These are of similar form to the better hafted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
and stemmed, chipped points, but they are of red or purple slate and
were ground at least as they were completed, though they may have been
first shaped by chipping, as some of them undoubtedly were. Some of
these are strikingly like the modern Eskimo knife. Dr. Beauchamp has
figured some of these slate knives in Bulletin 18, New York State Museum,
and says as to their distribution: “In some parts of Canada they are
about as common as in New York, being most abundant on both sides
of Lake Ontario. They have not been reported east of Lake Champlain,
except in its immediate vicinity, with the exception of one in Maine, nor
do they reach more than half way southward to the Pennsylvania line.”</p>

<p>Perhaps that class of implements known as gouges is more common
in the Champlain valley than elsewhere. These objects are of various
proportions, some being long and slender, others short and wide, but
whatever the shape, there is always the U-shaped groove which gives
the name. This groove may extend only a short distance from the cutting
edge as in the ordinary carpenter’s gouge, or it may go from end to end.
The gouges are usually fashioned from moderately soft stone though
some are of that which is very hard. They are generally well finished
and some are so regular in form and so beautifully smoothed and polished
that they are not surpassed by any specimens that we have. As a rule
they are of medium size, six or eight inches long, but most elegantly
finished specimens are in our museums that are fourteen to twenty inches
long.</p>

<p>What are called celts or hand axes are more numerous and, as a class,
somewhat ruder than the gouges, though some of them are as finely made
as possible.</p>

<p>Like the gouges the celts were rubbed and ground into shape, except
in very rare cases, when a very hard stone was shaped by flaking. They
are generally not more than four or five inches long, though some have
been found that are twice this size. The material is usually some sort of
very hard stone.</p>

<p>Of ruder sort than other implements are the numerous hammers. Often
these are merely water smoothed river or beach pebbles upon which no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
work at all has been expended, and the only proof of human usage is seen
in the battered ends. More rarely the hammer has been worked over its
whole surface. Of course hammers or other implements used for pounding
would not ordinarily be carried on long journeys and consequently would
not be likely to be found far from a somewhat permanent camp. Hence,
although very abundant in a few localities, these objects are not widely
distributed. And the same is true of the boiling stones, which are of
the same sort as the hammer stones, the difference being that the latter
bear the bruises caused by their use, while the pebbles which were heated
and thrown into the earthenware pots to heat the water show evidence of
being heated, but no abrasion.</p>

<p>The hammer stone when long and more or less slender becomes a pestle.
Pestles are not common though in all a considerable number have been
found in the Champlain valley. Some of these are only five or six inches
long, and from this size they may be found of various lengths and weights
to those over two feet long and weighing nearly thirty pounds. Some
of these large pestles are finely shaped and of hard stone, so that great labor
must have been expended in their making.</p>

<p>Several so-called pestles have been found in the region we are considering
which are especially interesting because they are not only well
shaped, but at one end they are carved to resemble the head of some
animal. These are long and slender and should probably be regarded as
clubs rather than pestles.</p>

<p>Without some sort of mortar the pestle would be of little use, and
where one is found the other may be expected. Yet it is noticeable that
mortars are very uncommon in this region. Some very excellent examples
have been found, but more often little labor was expended upon the
mortars beyond that necessary to hollow out the cavity. This cavity was
in some cases hollowed on one side only, but often there was made a
hollow on each side. These were usually circular and several inches deep,
but in some of the largest mortars the hollowed portion is oval and more
or less irregular. Naturally the mortars would be of considerable weight,
from ten to fifty pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>The most common axe or hatchet was undoubtedly the celt or hand
axe, already mentioned, but for heavier work larger axes were needed,
and these are found, though not in large numbers. These larger axes may
be six, eight or ten inches long and weigh several pounds, though we have
none as large as many which have been found in the west and south.
Some are very rude, others very carefully shaped and well finished. All
have a groove around them by which a handle could be more firmly
attached. These large grooved axes seem to us very clumsy and inefficient
tools, but Champlain in his account of making a camp for the night
on one of the large islands in the lake, says that his Indian companions cut
down large trees with these “meschantes haches,” so that they were certainly
much more useful than they appear to us to be.</p>

<p>There is a class of objects which seem to be more or less problematical.
They are of very different shape, but always quite unlike objects designed
for use as implements; always well and often very finely made and finished
and of handsome material. These occur on both sides of the lake and
form the chief treasures of collections. They are some of them suitable
for ornament or for ceremonial purposes, but some do not appear designed
for any known use. Nevertheless they are fashioned with such care and
are so attractive in themselves that it is not possible to regard them as unimportant
to those who made them. By different writers they have been
called as they are of one form or another—ceremonial stones, banner
stones, gorgets, etc. And it is more than probable that some were used
as indicated by these names, but some of them are quite puzzling. The
flat pieces of slate or other stone which are included among the specimens
mentioned are usually drilled once or twice and were apparently attached
to the clothing or hung about the neck as ornaments. Others, the so-called
banner stones, are thicker, of harder material, semi-lunar or more or less
crescent shape and have a large hole bored through the middle. It is
possible, but not certain, that these were in some way badges of office.
A very few of the so-called birdshead stones have also been found.</p>

<p>The discoidal stones, found especially in the south, are very rare in the
Champlain valley. A few rather rough specimens have been found, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
I have seen only one really fine specimen and this is small, about two and
a half inches in diameter, of white quartz and very finely made.</p>

<p>Stone and earthenware pipes, some of them of very interesting form and
finely polished are not numerous, but a goodly number have been found.
The earthenware pipes are of various shape, a few tubular, more with
bowl and stem, much like the modern pipe. The stone pipes are very
variable in form, no two being alike, but as elsewhere, finely finished.
Yet the pipes of the Champlain valley are much less elaborate than those
from the mounds or other localities, and none of the earthenware specimens
are effigies, or with head-shaped bowls, such as are found in New
York west of the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>A very interesting form of pipe has been found in Swanton, on the
Vermont side of the lake. A dozen or more of these have been obtained.
They are simply straight tubes of stone from seven to twelve inches long
and about an inch in diameter. They very closely resemble the tubular
pipes of the Pacific coast and South America.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the pipes of the Champlain valley rarely imitate any
human or animal form. I know of only one which resembles an animal and
two or three which bear on the bowl the human face.</p>

<p>Of earthenware or pottery a very great variety has been found. In this
more than in any of the stone objects we are able at least partially to
separate the Algonkian from the Iroquoian. The earthenware of the
Champlain valley is sometimes almost without decoration, but by far the
greater portion was ornamented at least about the rim and usually over
much of the upper portion and sometimes even inside the upper part for
one or two inches below the rim. No animal or human form is found in
any specimen. The form is always globular below, the rim being contracted
and variously shaped. In some cases the rim is quadrangular or
five or six sided, although as stated, the lower part is always globular.
Whole jars are, as is to be expected, very rare, but three fine specimens
from Vermont are in the University Museum and one was in the fine collection
of Dr. D. S. Kellogg of Plattsburgh, which was found near that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
place.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Large fragments, in some instances almost enough to reconstruct
a whole jar, have been found on both sides of the valley. For the most
part the pottery of the region is in fragments from the size of one’s hand
to mere bits not larger than a pea. These fragments have been found in
very great quantity. A short distance north of Plattsburgh near what is
locally called “The Creek,” there were evidently many jars made, for
some years ago the sand blown off revealed the old fireplaces where the
pots were burned and an immense number of fragments were picked up.
The decoration is in all cases indented, none in relief. It consists of all
sorts of figures, crescents, key-shaped figures, circles, dots, triangles,
squares, zigzags, etc., and groups of lines, arranged in every conceivable
fashion, all stamped or drawn on the clay when it was soft. Some of
the patterns are really very attractive and done with no little skill. Only
by the aid of plates can any adequate idea of the variety and elegance of
these designs or of the earthenware as a whole be given.</p>

<p>In quality the Champlain valley pottery varies as in every other respect.
Some of it is of the finest paste and carefully burned; some is of very coarse
material and more carelessly burned. Over the surface of most specimens
after the piece was shaped and perhaps partly dried, a thin, smooth paste
was added which covered the ruder mass of which the jar was mainly
composed. As to the size of most of the jars it is only possible to give an
approximate measure because of their fragmentary condition, but, with
those that are entire and the larger fragments as guides, it may be said that
they varied from those holding a pint to those holding ten quarts. As to
what may be called the nationality of the pottery, it may be noticed that
while there is much resemblance there are important differences. The
entire jars and the finest of the fragments are to be regarded as made by
Iroquois, while the simpler forms, especially those found on the eastern
side of the valley are Algonkian. While the work of the Iroquois is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
superior to that of the Algonkins, yet when it is remembered that all of
the pottery was made entirely by hand, the regularity of form and general
excellence are remarkable.</p>

<p>Soapstone dishes, such as are common in some parts of New England,
are also found here, but they are very infrequent and always badly broken.
Soapstone is not uncommon on the Vermont side of the valley, but the
ancient residents seem to have preferred to use pots of earthenware.</p>

<p>Bone was probably used by the aborigines to a much greater extent than
now appears, for this material was used to so great an extent by other
tribes and is so readily fashioned into certain classes of implements and was
always at hand that it would surely have been a common material for
many of the smaller implements, such as awls, needles, points for marking
pottery, fishing spears and the like.</p>

<p>Until within a few years only a very few bone objects of any sort had
been found, but recently quite a number of various sorts have been found
on the east shore of the lake and a few on the west. Some of these are
like the many-barbed spear points of the Eskimo, but most are the ordinary
awls, blunt points, etc. These latter were probably used mainly for
drawing the lines and figures on the unbaked pottery. Canine teeth of
the bear were carefully and evidently with no little labor cut or ground
until half was removed and the remaining half brought to a sharp edge.
As would be expected, objects of shell are uncommon and all that have
been found are marine and from southern species. The little marginella
conoidalis of the Carolina coast was used whole, evidently as beads, and
the columella of the ordinary conch was cut into large beads an inch or
more long and nearly as much in diameter. Like the beads made from the
marginella these were perforated longitudinally and the surface ground
smooth. These shell beads are interesting because they are proof of traffic
between the northern and southern tribes. Bits of coral several inches
long, the surface smoothed, have been found and furnish added evidence
of trade with other tribes, as none of these materials can be obtained from
northern waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>Native copper is not found nearer the Champlain valley than Lake
Superior, and here again we find proof of traffic with distant tribes,
for copper implements and ornaments of different sorts have been found
in several localities on both sides of the lake. Spear points, knives,
celts, gouges made from copper, beaten into shape, have been found, and
one large specimen weighing thirty-eight ounces, a celt eight inches long,
was evidently cast in a mould. This was found a few years ago at the
mouth of Otter creek, on the Vermont shore.</p>

<p>Besides those objects, which were for use as tools, there are copper
bars, which were probably ornaments, and small beads made by beating
the metal into sheets and rolling pieces of the thin copper into cylinders.
We cannot know much as to the age of the objects thus far mentioned.
It is certain that their use reaches back centuries before the coming of the
white men, but how far into the remote past of this country none may say.
When we find anything made from iron, however, there is no difficulty in
assigning it an age, since the French adventurers came to the American
wilderness and bartered their hatchets and other articles of iron for that
which they needed from the savages. Queer shaped axes or tomahawks,
pipes, etc., are now and then found always much rusted, but always of
interest.</p>

<p>In the preceding pages there has not been any attempt to give more
than a summary of what has been found during the past fifty or seventy-five
years in the Champlain valley, which illustrates somewhat the life and
handicraft of those to whom the region belonged before it was taken from
them by the incoming Europeans.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> There has recently appeared from the press of Small, Maynard &amp; Company, publishers of Boston,
Mass., an English version of “Art” by Auguste Rodin, containing 106 illustrations in halftone and
photogravure.</p>

<p>It is a most important contribution to the literature of “Art” by one of the greatest living sculptors. It
covers practically the whole range of art and abounds in the analyses of the works of the masters of painting
and sculpture, ancient and modern.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> It will be recalled that the Portuguese navigator, Antonio Galvão, as early as 1528, proposed to
Charles V, that interoceanic communication be opened across the Isthmus of Panama and that in 1550, he
is said to have published a book to demonstrate that such a canal could be constructed at Tehuantepec
Nicaragua, Panama or Darien. In 1551 Francisco Lopez de Gómara urged Philip II of Spain to proceed
with the undertaking without delay. (See Francisco Lopez de Gómara Hist. Gen’l. Lib. 4, Cap. 14,

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
